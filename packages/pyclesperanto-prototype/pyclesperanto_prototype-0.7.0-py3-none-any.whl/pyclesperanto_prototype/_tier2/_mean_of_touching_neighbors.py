    ----------
    values : Image
        A vector of values corresponding to the labels of which the mean 
    average should be determined.
    touch_matrix : Image
        A touch_matrix specifying which labels are taken into account for

    mean_values_destination : Image
        A the resulting vector of mean average values in the neighborhood.
