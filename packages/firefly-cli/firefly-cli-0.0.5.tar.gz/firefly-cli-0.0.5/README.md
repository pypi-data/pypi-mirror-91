A python-based command line interface for practically entering expenses in [Firefly III](https://www.firefly-iii.org).

*This project was inspired on [firefly-bot](https://github.com/vjFaLk/firefly-bot), a Telegram bot to create transactions in Firefly III. Some of the API code and examples were forked from this project.*

# Instalation
This CLI tool is available on PyPI. So the easiest way to install is:
```shell
# Install firefly-cli from PyPI
pip install firefly-cli

# Enjoy! Runs firefly-cli
firefly-cli
```

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the library module as a script:
```shell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/afonsoc12/firefly-cli.git

# Go to root directory
cd firefly-cli

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run module as a script
python -m firefly_cli
```

# Usage
The CLI has two modes of operation:
  - In one-line command style:
    
```shell
$ firefly-cli add 5.2, Large Mocha, Cash, Starbucks
```
  
  - Command Line Interface:
  
```bash
$ firefly-cli

# Setup
If you run firefly-cli, you will see that you do not have connection.
In order to configure your Firefly III `URL` and `API_TOKEN` you have to run these two commands (you can find [here](https://docs.firefly-iii.org/firefly-iii/api/#personal-access-token) how to find your API Personal Access Token):

```shell
# Start CLI, well this one does not count as a command üôÉ
firefly-cli

# Set your Firefly URL, such as https://firefly.mydomain.com
edit URL <YOUR URL>

# Set your Firefly API_TOKEN
edit API_TOKEN <YOUR API TOKEN>
```

After entering these values, firefly-cli will automatically refresh API connection. At any point you can refresh API connection by yourself:
```shell
# Refreshes API connection
refresh
```

Alternatively, you can create a `firefly-cli.ini` file and place it in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/firefly-cli/firefly-cli.ini` with the following content:
```yaml
[API]
url = https://firefly.yourdomain.com
api_token = eyXXX
```
**Note:** If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is not set, it defaults to `$HOME/.config/firefly-cli/firefly-cli.ini`

# Commands
The scope of this CLI is to enter expenses in a comma-separated style. Therefore, some commands do not have a "very polished" UI for the moment. I am looking forward to improve this soon!

If you find any bugs (which you WILL!), please submit a new issue or PR! I am more than happy to accept new suggestions, improvements and corrections.
