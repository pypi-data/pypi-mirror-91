Welcome to the repository for the `uncommitted` project!

You should be able to download and install the latest version with the
quick Python command:

    $ pip install uncommitted

Once `pip` has finished the install, you will be able to run the
`uncommitted` tool directly from the command line.  You can read its
documentation directly on the Python Package Index at the URL:
