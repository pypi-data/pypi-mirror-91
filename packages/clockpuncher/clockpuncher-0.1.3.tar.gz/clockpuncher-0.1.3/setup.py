    'long_description': "# ClockPuncher\n\n## Abstract\n\nThis is a small python utility app that is being designed for time-tracking. As the name suggests, this is trying to replace track.toggl.com for tracking my own work.\n\nThe end-goal is a local, open-source timer that is hackable and can automate specific tasks like uploading/submitting billable hours.\n\n## Images\n### 'Production' GUI for usage\n![Productions View](repo_resources/clockpuncher.gif)\n### Development GUI with logger and debugger windows\n![Development View](./repo_resources/development_mode.png)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe best way is to use [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) and run `pipx install clockpuncher` or `pipx run clockpuncher`.\n\nOn install a folder will be created in `~/.clockpuncher` to contain local data storage. It should contain a single folder 'data' with a sqlite db called `timer.db` and possibly wal files. It's literally just a sqlite database, you can access, query, and adjust as you would with any other database.\n\nYou can delete this folder without issue, but you will lose all your stored data.\n\n## Current Next Steps:\n* [X] Integrate sqlite DB of timer sessions\n* [X] Add inputs for specific task descriptions (text box)\n* [ ] Add on-the-fly graph representations\n  * [X] Task Breakdown\n  * [ ] Total Hours (per task and total)\n  * [ ] Total Billed (per task and total)\n* [ ] Add report CSV output\n* [ ] Add tests for main.py + gui module\n* [X] Put on PyPI\n* [X] Setup with pipx for app deployment\n* [ ] Add user settings with persistent storage\n* [ ] Add database back-up/cold-storage option\n\n## Repo Structure\n\nThis repo follows a pretty standard layout with `main.py` being the GUI front-end + database composed together to make the stopwatch app itself.\n\n\n### Outline:\n\n* `clockpuncher/`  - contains all code required to run Clock Puncher\n   * `main.py` - The main file that combines GUI, database, and application logic to make the above images\n   * `database.py` - Contains the Database class that does CRUD operations for main.py\n   * `models.py` - Dataclasses that represent rows in the Entries and Projects table\n   * `data/` - Contains local data storage. In production it stores data in `data/timer.db`\n   * `gui/` - All reusable GUI components\n     * `base_gui.py` - Base GUI class with loggers and basic development/production switchers.\n     * `dev_gui.py` - This holds quick GUI screens tossed together for development.\n     * `entry_visualization.py` - Contains task_chart and entry_table components and their class definitions\n      * `timer.py` - Contains Timer and Number GUI components that make up the clock display\n   * `tests` - Test suite using Pytest + Hypothesis\n\n",
