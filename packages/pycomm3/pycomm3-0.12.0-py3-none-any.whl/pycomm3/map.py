    """
    A simple enum-like class that allows dict-like __getitem__() and get() lookups.
    __getitem__() and get() are case-insensitive and bidirectional

    example:

    class TestEnum(Pycomm3EnumMap):
        x = 100

    >>> TestEnum.x
    100
    >>> TestEnum['X']
    100
    >>> TestEnum[100]
    x

    Note: this class is really only to be used internally, it doesn't cover anything more than simple subclasses
    (as in attributes only, don't add methods except for classmethods)
    It's really just to provide dict-like item access with enum-like attributes.
