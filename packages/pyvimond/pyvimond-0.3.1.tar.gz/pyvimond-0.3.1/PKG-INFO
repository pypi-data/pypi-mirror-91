Description: # pyvimond
        
        Tiny Python client library for various Vimond APIs. Currently it provides clients for:
        
        * Vimond REST API
        * Vimond Image Service
        
        ## Usage
        
        The examples here can be found in the example files in the project root directory
        
        ### Vimond REST API
        
        ```python
        from pyvimond.vimond_client import VimondClient
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Create a client
            api_url = "https://vimond"
            user = "user"
            secret = "secret"
            vimond = VimondClient(api_url, user, secret)
        
            # Get an asset
            asset = vimond.get_asset(1334686)
            print(asset["uri"])
        
            # Get the asset's category
            category = vimond.get_category(asset["categoryId"])
            print(category["category"]["@uri"])
        
            # Get the metadata for the asset
            metadata = vimond.get_asset_metadata(1334686)
            print(metadata)
        ```
        
        ### Vimond Image Service
        
        The client uses HTTP Basic authentication when interfacing with Vimond Image Service
        
        ```python
        from pyvimond.vimond_image_service_client import VimondImageServiceClient
        
        if __name__ == "__main__":
            # Create a client
            api_url = "https://image-service"
            username = "user"
            password = "secret"
            vimond_image_service = VimondImageServiceClient(api_url, username, password)
        
            # Create an image pack
            imagepack_id = vimond_image_service.create_image_pack()
            print(f"Created new imagepack with ID {imagepack_id}")
        
            # Update the "main" location with the image from a publicly accessible URL.
            # The function will return an ID consisting of the imagepack ID plus the current UNIX timestamp. This
            # can eventually be used to reference this version of the image (assuming it gets cached somewhere) even after
            # the image has been updated later on.
            public_url = "https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2020/12/03/12/35/sunset-5800386_960_720.jpg"
            timestamped_imagepack_id = vimond_image_service.send_image(imagepack_id, public_url, "main")
        
            # Get the URL to the timestamped version with location "main"
            url = vimond_image_service.create_image_url(timestamped_imagepack_id, location="main")
            print(url)
        
            # Get the URL to the untimestamped version and no location
            url_without_location = vimond_image_service.create_image_url(imagepack_id)
            print(url_without_location)
        ```
        
        ## Testing
        
        ```bash
        python3 -m unittest discover
        ```
        
        ## Releasing
        
        Before beginning, make sure you have the necessary tools installed:
        
        ```bash
        pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel twine
        ```
        
        To build a new distribution and publish it on PyPi:
        
        1. Update the version number in `setup.py`
        2. Run `rm -rf build dist` to remove any previous build artifacts 
        2. Run `python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel` to build the new distribution
        3. Run `twine upload dist/*`. When asked for credentials, use `__token__` as username and the output 
           of `vault -l pypi-pyvimond-api-token` as password.
