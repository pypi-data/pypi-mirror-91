"""
biosignalsnotebooks module responsible for loading data from the available signal samples (used on
biosignalsnotebooks Notebooks).

Available Functions
-------------------
[Public]

load_signal
    Function that returns a dictionary with the data contained inside a signal sample file
    (stored in the biosignalsnotebooks signal samples directory).

[Private]

_generate_download_google_link
    Google Drive sharable links do not allow a direct download with wget function, so, this private
    function manipulates the input link to ensure the desired download.

    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Function that returns a dictionary with the data contained inside 'signal_name' file (stored in
    the biosignalsnotebooks signal samples directory).

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    Biosignalsnotebooks library provides data samples in order to the users that are new to biosignals data handling to
    have a place to start without the need to acquire new data. This sample files are stored in the folder
    _signal_samples inside the library.

    This function returns the data from the selected sample.

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_name : file name or url
        Name that identifies the signal sample to be loaded or a url.
