    With this function the user can easily generate a Poincaré Plot (Heart rate variability
    analysis).

smooth
    Function intended to smooth a signal through the application of the convolution operation
    between a moving average window (the signal is segmented into multiple parts) and a fixed window
    (from one of the predefined formats 'hanning', 'blackman'...) in order to a weigh be attributed
    to each sample inside the moving window.

    This functions computes the Fast Fourier Transform of a signal, returning the frequency and magnitude values.

lowpass
    For a given signal s rejects (attenuates) the frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency f and passes the
    frequencies lower than that value by applying a Butterworth digital filter.

highpass
    For a given signal s rejects (attenuates) the frequencies lower then the cutoff frequency f and passes the
    frequencies higher than that value by applying a Butterworth digital filter.

bandstop
    For a given signal s rejects (attenuates) the frequencies within a certain range (between f1 and f2) and passes the
    frequencies outside that range by applying a Butterworth digital filter.

bandpass
    For a given signal s passes the frequencies within a certain range (between f1 and f2) and rejects (attenuates) the

    Brief
    -----
    Function for generation of Poincaré Plot (Heart rate variability analysis).

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    ECG signals measure the electric potential in the heart of the subject. In normal conditions, it is expeted that the
    the electric potential to be similar in different heartbeats and that the rhythm of those heartbeats to be
    maintained if all the conditions are maintained. Thus, by plotting the current RR interval against the previous one,
    it is expected that the values to be maintained. Poincaré plot, is this representation, which allows to analyse the
    heart rate variability.

    This function returns the x and y axis of a Poincaré plot and also the standard deviations of the more
    representative directions of the data points.

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : list
        ECG signal or R peak list. When the input is a raw signal the input flag signal should be
        True.

    sample_rate : int
        Sampling frequency.

    signal : boolean
        If True, then the data argument contains the set of the ECG acquired samples.

    in_seconds : boolean
        If the R peaks list defined as the input argument "data" contains the sample numbers where
        the R peaks occur,
        then in_seconds needs to be True.

    Returns
    -------
    out : list, list, float, float
        Poincaré plot x axis and y axis, respectively. Additionally it will be returned SD1 and SD2
        parameters.

    -----
    Brief
    -----
    Smooth the data using a window with requested size.

    -----------
    Description
    -----------
    This method is based on the convolution of a scaled window with the signal.
    The signal is prepared by introducing reflected copies of the signal (with the window size) in both ends so that
    transient parts are minimized in the beginning and end part of the output signal.

    The results of the application of this functions is analogous to the application of a mean filter in image
    processing. The results is the smoothed input_signal.

    ----------
    Parameters
    ----------
    input_signal: array-like
        the input signal
    window_len: int
        the dimension of the smoothing window. the default is 10.
    window: string.
        the type of window from 'flat', 'hanning', 'hamming', 'bartlett', 'blackman'.
        flat window will produce a moving average smoothing. the default is 'hanning'.

    Returns
    -------
    out :   signal_filt: array-like the smoothed signal.

    @example:
                time = linspace(-2,2,0.1)
                input_signal = sin(t)+randn(len(t))*0.1

                numpy.convolve, scipy.signal.lfilter


    @todo: the window parameter could be the window itself if an array instead
    of a string

    @bug: if window_len is equal to the size of the signal the returning
    signal is smaller.

    Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a method to computationally calculate the Fourier Transform of discrete finite
