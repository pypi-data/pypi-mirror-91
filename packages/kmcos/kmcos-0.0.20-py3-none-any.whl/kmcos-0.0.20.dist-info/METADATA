kmcos: Kinetic Monte Carlo of Systems
=====================================
*kmcos is designed for lattice based Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations to understand chemical kinetics and mechanisms. It has been used to produce more than 10 scientific publications. A quickstart as well as tutorials and other documentation are below.*


QUICKSTART
##########

Prepare a minimal input file with the following content and save it as ``mini_101.ini`` ::

    [Meta]
    author = Your Name
    email = you@server.com
    model_dimension = 2
    model_name = fcc_100

    [Species empty]
    color = #FFFFFF

    [Species CO]
    representation = Atoms("CO", [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 1.17]])
    color = #FF0000

    [Lattice]
    cell_size = 3.5 3.5 10.0

    [Layer simple_cubic]
    site hollow = (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)
    color = #FFFFFF

    [Parameter k_CO_ads]
    value = 100
    adjustable = True
    min = 1
    max = 1e13
    scale = log

    [Parameter k_CO_des]
    value = 100
    adjustable = True
    min = 1
    max = 1e13
    scale = log

    [Process CO_ads]
    rate_constant = k_CO_ads
    conditions = empty@hollow
    actions = CO@hollow
    tof_count = {'adsorption':1}

    [Process CO_des]
    rate_constant = k_CO_des
    conditions = CO@hollow
    actions = empty@hollow
    tof_count = {'desorption':1}

In the same directory run ``kmcos export mini_101.ini``. You should now have a folder ``mini_101_local_smart``
in the same directory. ``cd`` into it and run ``kmcos benchmark``. If everything went well you should see something
like ::

    Using the [local_smart] backend.
    1000000 steps took 1.51 seconds
    Or 6.62e+05 steps/s

In the same directory try running ``kmcos view`` to watch the model run or fire up ``kmcos shell``
to interact with the model interactively. Explore more commands with ``kmcos help`` and please
refer to the documentation how to build complex model and evaluate them systematically. To test all bells and whistles try ``kmcos edit mini_101.ini`` and inspect the model visually.
