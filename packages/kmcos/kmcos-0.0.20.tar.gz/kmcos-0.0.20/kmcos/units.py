"""
    Several commonly used constants and conversion factors are offered
    by this module, such a pi, the speed of light, the Planck constant,
    the charge of an electron, k_Boltzmann, the atomic masses of carbon
    and oxygen, the mass of a nucleon, one angstrom in meter, and one
    bar in Pascal.
