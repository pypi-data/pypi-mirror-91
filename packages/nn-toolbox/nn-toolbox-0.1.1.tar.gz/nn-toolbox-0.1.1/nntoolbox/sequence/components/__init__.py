"""
For RNN, the hierarchy of components should be:

    Cell => Layer => StackedLayer

Cell is the basic computing unit, processing every timestep. Layer takes a cell and apply it across the temporal
dimensions. StackedLayer stacks layers on top of each other and sequentially apply them in a depthwise manner.
