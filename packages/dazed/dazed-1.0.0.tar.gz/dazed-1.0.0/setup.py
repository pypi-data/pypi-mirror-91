Note: I\nam using sparse string labels here but dazed\'s interfaces can cope with integers,\nonehot encoded arrays and dataframes as well (refer to the\n`API Reference <https://dazed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html>`_\nfor more information).\n\nImagine your building a machine learning model to catalogue a pet store\'s\ninventory (primarily cats, dogs and fish). The owner has given you an image of\neach animal and you\'ve trained your model and made some predictions. Your data\nlooks like:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   filenames = [\n      "img0.jpg", "img1.jpg", "img2.jpg", "img3.jpg", "img4.jpg", "img5.jpg"\n   ]\n   truth = ["cat", "dog", "cat", "dog", "fish", "dog"]\n   pred = ["cat", "dog", "dog", "cat", "fish", "cat"]\n\nIn order to understand how your model is doing, you make a quick confusion\nmatrix:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   from dazed import ConfusionMatrix\n\n   cm = ConfusionMatrix.from_sparse(truth, pred, info=filenames)\n   print(cm)\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n     | 0 1 2     index | label\n   ---------     -------------\n   0 | 1 1 0         0 |   cat\n   1 | 2 1 0         1 |   dog\n   2 | 0 0 1         2 |  fish\n   ---------     -------------\n\nFrom the confusion matrix it looks like the model might be prone to thinking that\ndogs are actually cats. To double check:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   cm.most_confused()\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   [(\'dog\', \'cat\', 2), (\'cat\', \'dog\', 1)]\n\nAh yes, dogs were predicted to be cats twice and cats to be dogs\nonce. To try and find out what the problem might be you decide that you should\ncheck the images. To get the appropiate images:\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   cm.label_pair_info("dog", "cat")\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   [\'img3.jpg\', \'img5.jpg\']\n\nUpon investigating the images you notice that both dogs are white. You\ndecide to go back through and label your images for animal colour.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   truth = [\n      ["cat", "white"],\n      ["dog", "brown"],\n      ["cat", "brown"],\n      ["dog", "white"],\n      ["fish", "orange"],\n      ["dog", "white"]\n   ]\n   pred = [\n      ["cat", "white"],\n      ["dog", "brown"],\n      ["dog", "brown"],\n      ["cat", "white"],\n      ["fish", "orange"],\n      ["cat", "white"]\n   ]\n   cm = ConfusionMatrix.from_sparse(\n      truth, pred, info=filenames, multilabel=True\n   )\n   print(cm)\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n     | 0 1 2 3 4     index |        label\n   -------------     --------------------\n   0 | 0 0 1 0 0         0 |   cat, brown\n   1 | 0 1 0 0 0         1 |   cat, white\n   2 | 0 0 1 0 0         2 |   dog, brown\n   3 | 0 2 0 0 0         3 |   dog, white\n   4 | 0 0 0 0 1         4 | fish, orange\n   -------------     --------------------\n\nHmm looks like all white dogs were miss classified as white cats.\n\n.. code-block::\n\n   cm.most_confused()\n\n.. code-block:: console\n\n   [(\'dog, white\', \'cat, white\', 2), (\'cat, brown\', \'dog, brown\', 1)]\n\nAh yes looks like your model might be basing much of its prediction on animal\ncolour, maybe time to go collect some more data.\n\nTo find out more about dazed take a look at the `API Reference <https://dazed.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_reference.html>`_.\n',
