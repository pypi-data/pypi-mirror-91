# We need this so that we can generate a hash of the image (one read)
# and later send the image contents (a second read) without _necessarily_
# storing the full image in RAM. This way, with some careful handling, the
# API can be used to process a very large number of very large images
# concurrently without hogging the RAM of the machine.
#
# If a string is provided, it is interpreted as a filename.
# If bytes, its contents are taken as the byte contents of the
# image file.
# If a StreamFactory (that is, a function which takes no parameters and returns
# an AsyncBufferedReader), then the factory may be called multiple times to
# read the file multiple times.
