# Jira one
A REST API Implementation to Jira Cloud APIs for creating reports

## Configurations
Install using `pip`. you have to be on python >= 3.6.x in order to utilize this script.
```bash
pip install jiraone
```

## Classes, functions and methods
Jiraone comes with various classes, functions and methods. Aliases as well, are used to represent
links to classes and functions. The major ones to take note of are the below
* `LOGIN` -&gt; This is a call to the `Credentials` class and the accepted parameters are
  * user -&gt; string
  * password -&gt; string
  * url -&gt; string
  * example usage: LOGIN(user="username", password="token", url="http://example.com")
* `endpoint` -&gt; This is an alias to the `EndPoints` class and has many methods that can be called directly
  * example usage: `endpoint.myself()`, `endpoint.search_users()`
* `echo` -&gt; A copy of the PrettyPrint Class used to nicely format a printed result. to call, simply use the function `echo`
  * example usage: 
     ```python
    from jiraone import echo
    
    data = "hello world"
    echo(data)
    # prints //
    # hello world
     ```
* `add_log` -&gt; This is a function used log messages to a log file. it accepts two parameters `message` and `level`.
the function uses the logging module and writes a log based on 3 levels, "debug", "info" or "error". The message part
is a string used to denote what is written to the log.
  * example usage:
     ```python
    from jiraone import add_log
    
    message = "successfully Initiated the script"
    add_log(message, "info")
     ```
* `WORK_PATH` -&gt; This is simply the absolute path to where all files used or created in conjunction to the path where the script is
being called from.
* `PROJECT` -&gt; This is an alias to the `Project` class and it includes other methods that helps in quickly generating a
desired report.
* `USER` -&gt; This is an alias to the `User` class and it includes other methods that helps in quickly generating a
desired report.
* `csv_writer` -&gt; This function helps in creating a csv file. it comes with the below parameters 
  * `folder` -> string: a path to the name of the folder
  * `file_name` -> string: the name of the file being created
  * `data` -> iterable: an iterable data of any sort.
  * `mark` -> string: helps evaluates how data is created, available options ["single", "many"]
  * `mode` -> string: file mode, available options ["a", "w", "a+", "w+", "wb"]
* `csv_reader`  -&gt; This function helps in reading a csv file and returning a list comprehension of the data. Accepted
parameter include
  * `folder` -> string: a path to the name of the folder
  * `file_name` -> string: the name of the file being created
  * `mode` -> string: file mode, available options ["r", "rb"]
* `path_builder` -&gt; This function helps to build a directory path and file path then returns the file path in the directory.
parameters include
  * `path` -> string: a path to declare absolute to where the script is executed.
  * `file_name` -> string: the name of the file being created

For further knowledge on how to use the classes, methods or functions. Open the jiraone package and read the docstring on the
aforementioned methods or functions above to get further information.

## Using the API
Jiraone basically allows you to create a report based method using Atlassian REST API on your cloud infrastructure.
it uses a class method on the Endpoint Class, so you can easily call the direct Atlassian API.
In generating reports, you can create functions, classes or even methods to derive the desired results.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, endpoint

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


def priorities():
        load = LOGIN.get(endpoint.get_all_priorities())
        if load.status_code == 200:
             # some expression here
             ...
```
The Script comes with a User and Project Classes which includes basic reporting examples. The User class has a user generator,
which easily enables you to fetch all users on the instance without you programming such yourself.
All these methods and functions are accessible directly from the jiraone package.

## Basic Report Usage
The script comes with some basic reporting Classes and methods which you can use to generate a report in CSV format.
currently only CSV file output is supported. other format such as JSON might be available in future.
* generate a report of all active users in your instance
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    USER.get_all_users(pull="active", user_type="atlassian", file="user_file.csv")
```
* generate a report of users in your instance, who has BROWSE access to the projects on the instance.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    PROJECT.projects_accessible_by_users("expand=insight,description", "searchBy=key,name", permission="BROWSE",
                                        pull="active", user_type="atlassian")
```
* generate a report of the number of Dashboard on the Instance, who's the owner and who it is shared with.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    PROJECT.dashboards_shared_with()
```
* generate a report of all user in the instance and which group do they belong to
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, USER

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    USER.get_all_users_group(pull="active", user_type="atlassian")
```
* generate a report get all project list and users within a project as well as their corresponding project role in the project.
```python
from jiraone import LOGIN, PROJECT

user = "email"
password = "token"
link = "https://yourinstance.atlassian.net"
LOGIN(user=user, password=password, url=link)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    # the output of the file would be absolute to the directory where this python file is being executed from
    PROJECT.get_all_roles_for_projects(pull="active", user_type="atlassian")
```
