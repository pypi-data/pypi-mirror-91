Description: Change-O - Repertoire clonal assignment toolkit
        ================================================================================
        
        Change-O is a collection of tools for processing the output of V(D)J alignment
        tools, assigning clonal clusters to immunoglobulin (Ig) sequences, and
        reconstructing germline sequences.
         
        Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing technologies now enable 
        large-scale characterization of Ig repertoires, defined as the collection of
        trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on the surface of B cells and
        T cells. Change-O is a suite of utilities to facilitate advanced analysis of
        Ig and TCR sequences following germline segment assignment. Change-O
        handles output from IMGT/HighV-QUEST and IgBLAST, and provides a wide variety of
        clustering methods for assigning clonal groups to Ig sequences. Record sorting, 
        grouping, and various database manipulation operations are also included.
