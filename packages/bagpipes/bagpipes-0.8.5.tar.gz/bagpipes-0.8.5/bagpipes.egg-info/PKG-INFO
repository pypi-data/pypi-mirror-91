Description: **Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation**
        
        Bagpipes is a state of the art code for generating realistic model galaxy spectra and fitting these to spectroscopic and photometric observations. For further information please see the Bagpipes documentation at `bagpipes.readthedocs.io <http://bagpipes.readthedocs.io>`_.
        
        Bagpipes can be installed with pip:
        
        .. code::
        
            pip install bagpipes
        
        Please note you cannot run the code just by cloning the repository as the large grids of models aren't included.
