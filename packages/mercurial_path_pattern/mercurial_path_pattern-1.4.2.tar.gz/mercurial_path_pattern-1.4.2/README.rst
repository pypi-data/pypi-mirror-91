Mercurial Path Pattern
=======================================================

Don't repeat yourself defining ``[paths]`` over many repositories,
specify the general rule once in ``~/.hgrc``.

Path Pattern is a Mercurial_ extension used to define default
remote path aliases. You may find it helpful if you maintain
consistently layed out repository trees on a few machines.

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 2

.. sectnum::

Path Pattern mostly works behind the courtains, making standard
commands like ``hg pull``, ``hg push``, and ``hg incoming`` aware of
extra paths. Still, it implements some commands, in particular ``hg
cloneto «path-alias»`` (clone to remote address specified by short
name).


Using path patterns
=======================================================

Install the extension as described below.

Simple example
-------------------------------------------------------

Write in your ``~/.hgrc``::

    [extensions]
    mercurial_path_pattern =

    [path_pattern]
    lagrange.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    lagrange.remote =  ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/{repo}
    bbssh.local = ~/devel/public/{below}
    bbssh.remote = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Johny/{below:/=-}

Imagine ``~/devel/personal/blog/drafts`` and ``~/devel/public/pymods/acme``
are both some mercurial repositories. Then::

    cd ~/devel/personal/blog/drafts
    hg push lagrange
    # Works, pushes to ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/personal/blog/drafts

    cd ~/devel/public/pymods/acme
    hg pull lagrange
    # Works, pulls from ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/public/pymods/acme
    hg pull bbssh
    # Works too, pulls from ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Johny/pymods-acme

This works in spite of the fact, that those repos lack ``.hg/hgrc``.

For two repositories that's not very useful, but once you have hundred
of them, managing individual ``.hg/hgrc`` becomes a hassle (imagine
changing ``lagrange.mekk.net`` to ``lagrange.mekk.com`` everywhere, or
maybe adding second remote alias for the new development machine).

.. note::

   On Windows extension tries to handle (in ``.local`` specifications)
   both native paths (``C:\repos\sth``) and portable ones
   (``C:/repos/sth``), but it is recommended to use the
   latter. Whichever syntax is used, extracted ``{fragments}`` contain
   ``/`` (so they can be easily used in remote urls).

Overriding repository-level paths
-------------------------------------------------------

By default path patterns have lower priority than per-repository
paths, so in case you define ``lagrange`` path on repository level, it
won't be overwritten by the pattern. You can augment it by adding
``.enforce``::

    [path_pattern]
    lagrange.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    lagrange.remote =  ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/{repo}
    lagrange.enforce = true

With such config pattern wins against any path from ``.hg/hgrc``
(usually it is not recommended but can be handy if you have some
broken path scattered around repositories).

Reusing the same alias
--------------------------------------------------------

To (re)use the same alias in a few different locations, use
``ALIAS.XTRA.local`` and ``ALIAS.XTRA.remote`` keys, where ``XTRA``
is something unique. For example::

    [path_pattern]
    production.main.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    production.main.remote = ssh://www-owner@www.acme.org/public/{repo}
    production.beta.local = ~/experiments/{repo}
    production.beta.remote = ssh://www-owner@beta.acme.org/public/{repo}

would let you ``hg push production`` not only in
``~/devel/website/blog`` but also in ``~/experiments/website/qagame``
(pushing to ``www.acme.org`` in the former, and to ``beta.acme.org`` in the
latter case). Whether this is a good idea, is up to you.



Clone-supporting commands
=======================================================

Using ``cloneto``
-------------------------------------------------------

The ``cloneto`` command makes it easier to clone repository to remote url::

    hg cloneto lagrange
    # Equivalent to 
    #   hg clone . ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/pymodules/acme
    # but noticeably shorter

which works both for normal paths and paths derived from patterns, but
is especially handy with patterns. In particular, it makes
it possible to push newly created repository, for example::

    cd ~/devel/libs
    hg init xyz
    cd xyz
    hg cloneto lagrange
    # Works, creates sources/libs/xyz on johny@lagrange.mekk.net

.. note::

   While ``cloneto`` is particularly useful with patterns, it works
   for usual paths as well. You can write (new) path to repository-level
   ``.hg/hgrc``, then ``hg cloneto «new-name»``.

Instead of ``clonefrom``
-------------------------------------------------------

There is no ``clonefrom`` command (at least for now), but it is not
really needed. The following works (imagine ``libs/zzz`` exists on
``lagrange.mekk.net``, but is not yet cloned *here*)::

    cd ~/devel/libs
    hg init zzz
    cd zzz
    hg pull lagrange


Testing pattern configuration
=======================================================

The standard::

    hg paths

command lists paths defined for current repository, after pattern
expansion. Use it (in a few different repositories) to verify whether
your patterns generate proper paths.

The::

    hg list_path_patterns

command prints all patterns found in configuration. Use it to detect
typos causing some patterns to be ignored and to check the final
result of configuration processing.


Pattern syntax
=======================================================

Introduction
--------------------

Patterns are defined in ``[path_pattern]`` section of mercurial
configuration file (typically ``~/.hgrc``).  You may have as many
patterns as you like. Example illustrating various syntax elements::

    [path_pattern]
    lagrange.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    lagrange.remote =  ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/{repo}
    euler.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    euler.remote =  ssh://johny@euler.mekk.net/devel/{repo:/=.}/hg
    wrk.local = ~/work/{what}
    wrk.remote =  https://tim@devel-department.local/{what:/=__:\=__}
    ugly.local = ~/(topic)/sources/{subpath}/repo
    ugly.remote = ssh://hg{topic}@devel.local/{topic}/{subpath}
    cfg.dotcfg.local = ~/.config/{repo}
    cfg.dotcfg.remote = ssh://hgrepos@central.com/configs/riemann-config/{repo}
    cfg.dotshr.local = ~/.local/share/{repo}
    cfg.dotshr.remote = ssh://hgrepos@central.com/configs/riemann-local/{repo}
    official.hgstable.local = ~/tracked/mercurial/hg-stable
    official.hgstable.remote = http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable
    official.thg.local = ~/tracked/mercurial/tortoisehg-stable
    official.thg.remote = https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg
    official.evolve.local = ~/tracked/mercurial/mutable-history
    official.evolve.remote = https://bitbucket.org/marmoute/mutable-history

Pattern definition
---------------------

Every pattern is defined by the pair of keys - ``«alias».local`` and
``«alias».remote`` - or, in case the same alias is to be used in a few
places, by ``«alias».«sth».local`` and ``«alias».«sth».remote`` (where
``«sth»`` is anything making the key unique).

While processing patterns, the extension matches current repository
root path against ``local`` pattern, and if it matches, calculates
remote path by filling markers present there, and defines the path alias.

The ``.local`` part should specify absolute repository path (``~`` and
``~user`` are allowed). Some part(s) of the path may be replaced with
``{brace}`` or ``(paren)`` markers:

- ``{brace}`` matches everything aggressively (to the very end, unless
  some fixed text follows it),

- ``(paren)`` is limited to single path item and does not cross ``/`` or ``\\`` characters).

Those parts will be extracted from local repository path and available
for use in remote path being defined.

.. note::

    Typically there will be single ``{marker}`` on the end, but more
    obscure patterns are possible (as ``ugly`` above
    illustrates). 

Markers are optional, if no marker is used (see ``official`` above),
rule applies to exactly one repository. This may make sense (over
defining path in given repo ``.hg/hgrc``) if you prefer to centralize
your remote paths list (or if you frequently drop those repos to re-clone
them again later).

The ``.remote`` part defines appropriate remote address. This is typical
Mercurial remote path, but ``{marker}``'s can be used to refer to
values extracted from local path: ``{sth}`` is replaced with whatever
matched ``{sth}`` or ``(sth)`` present in local path.

Simple modifications are supported – ``{sth:x=y}`` means *take whatever
was extracted as* ``sth`` *and replace any* ``x`` *with* ``y``. This is
mostly used to replace ``/`` with some other character (in particular
``{below:/=-}`` handles BitBucket convention, replacing slashes with minuses).
Replacements can be multi-letter, for example ``{sth:lib=library}``.

Replacements can be chained if necessary – ``{sth:x=y:v=z}`` means
*take whatever was extracted as* ``sth``, *replace any* ``x`` *with*
``y``, *then replace any* ``v`` *with* ``z``, *then use the final
result*.

.. note::

    In case multiple patterns of the same name match, extension tries
    to find *best* one.  See `Pattern priority`_ chapter below.


Resolution example
--------------------

With definitions quoted above, if you happen to work
inside the ``~/devel/python/libs/webby`` repository, the extension will:

1. Find that ``lagrange.local`` matches and that ``{repo}`` is
   ``python/libs/webby``.   Filling ``lagrange.remote`` with
   that value generates
   ``ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/python/libs/webby``, so
   the following path alias is created:
   ``lagrange=ssh://johny@lagrange.mekk.net/sources/python/libs/webby``

2. Discover that ``euler.local`` also matches, and ``{repo}`` is again
   ``python/libs/webby``. After replacing ``/``-s with ``.``-s,
   that brings alias 
   ``euler=ssh://johny@euler.mekk.net/devel/python.libs.webby/hg``

3. Ignore remaining patterns as they do not match.

Or, in ``~/tracked/mercurial/tortoisehg-stable``, the extension will:

1. Note that ``official.thg.local`` matches (at this time without
   defining anything), extract matching path from
   ``official.thg.remote``, and finally generate for this repository
   path ``official = https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg`` (so ``hg
   pull official`` works there).  Note that the path alias is just
   ``official``, the ``.thg.`` part was used only to group appropriate
   config items.

2. Ignore remaining patterns which do not match.


Legacy syntax
------------------------------------------------------

For compatibility reasons, there exist alternative way
to reuse the same path alias. For example, instead of
(currently recommended)::

    [path_pattern]
    production.web.local = ~/devel/web/{repo}
    production.web.remote = ssh://product@acme.org/www/{repo}
    production.db.local = ~/devel/database/{repo}
    production.db.remote = ssh://product@backend.acme.org/db/{repo}
    production.monit.local = ~/devel/monitoring/{repo}
    production.monit.remote = ssh://product@monit.acme.org/{repo}

one can use ``.alias``::

    [path_pattern]
    production.local = ~/devel/web/{repo}
    production.remote = ssh://product@acme.org/www/{repo}
    dbproduction.db.local = ~/devel/database/{repo}
    dbproduction.db.remote = ssh://product@backend.acme.org/db/{repo}
    dbproduction.alias = production
    monproduction.local = ~/devel/monitoring/{repo}
    monproduction.remote = ssh://product@monit.acme.org/{repo}
    monproduction.alias = production

Both those syntaxes give meaning to ``hg push production`` in all matching
repositories.

.. note::

   I keep supporting ``.alias`` syntax for backward compatibility (it
   was the initial syntax provided for the task) but it is more
   elaborate and less readable, so I don't recommend it anymore.


Pattern priority
=======================================================

It is possible to write patterns so they *conflict* (more than one
definition of some path exists). While not frequent, such approach has
sometimes it's uses.

Path aliases have the following priority:

- enforced patterns (patterns with ``.enforce`` set),
- per repo aliases (standard ``[paths]`` defined in ``.hg/hgrc``),
- non-enforced patterns.

So, for example, with::

    [path_pattern]
    acme.local = ~/devel/{repo}
    acme.remote =  ssh://johny@apps.mekk.net/code/{repo}
    acme.enforce = true
    acme.alt.local = ~/devel/libs/{repo}
    acme.alt.remote =  ssh://johny@libs.mekk.net/{repo}

(both patterns define the same alias ``acme``) executing ``hg push
acme`` in ``~/devel/libs/calc`` will push to
``ssh://johny@apps.mekk.net/code/libs/calc`` as enforced pattern wins
over non-enforced one. The same will happen even if ``acme`` is
defined in per-repository ``.hg/hgrc`` (among standard ``[paths]``).

If more than one pattern of the same strength matches, extension tries
it's best to pick one with more specific local path, for example if we
drop ``acme.enforce`` from the example above (or if we add
``acme.alt.enforce``), executing ``hg push acme`` in
``~/devel/libs/calc`` will push to ``ssh://johny@libs.mekk.net/calc``
as more specific pattern wins.

.. note::

    It's not always obvious which pattern is more specific (compare
    ``~/(klass)/libs/base`` with ``~/src/{repo}``). Current
    implementation looks for the length of non-varying prefix (so the
    latter will win over the former as ``~/src/`` is longer than
    ``~/``). If those are of equal length, pattern with more non-var characters wins,
    and finally, the one which happened last in the config file.

    Some details may change in the future, use ``enforce`` when in
    doubt (or let me know if numeric priority would be useful).




Tips and tricks
=======================================================

``default`` as path pattern
--------------------------------------------------------

You can define ``default`` via path pattern if you wish::

    [path_pattern]
    default.hobby.local = ~/hobby/{repo}
    default.hobby.remote =  ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Johny/{below:/=-}
    default.wrk.local = ~/work/{what}
    default.wrk.remote =  https://tim@devel-department.local/{what}

(here in ``~/hobby`` I push to bitbucket by default, but in ``~/work``
to department server).

.. note::

   Mercurial will sooner or later define ``default`` path in
   per-repository ``.hg/hgrc`` files.  Enforce your patterns
   (``default.hobby.enforce = true``) if you need to defeat those
   settings. Or don't, if you want those patterns for defaults only.


Special treatment of specific repositories 
-------------------------------------------------------

It happens that some repository (or a few) *does not match* the
general rule. In such a case, one can simply overwrite given alias
on repository level, or use pattern priority.

My real example is `Keyring Extension`_ repository. While I generally
use dash (``-``) as path separator (so Path Pattern is located at
``/Mekk/mercurial-path_pattern`` and `Dynamic Username`_ at
``/Mekk/mercurial-dynamic_username``), keyring repo predates this
convention and is named ``/Mekk/mercurial_keyring``. So I solve this
by::

    [path_pattern]
    # By default bitbucket mirrors my dir structure replacing / with -
    bbssh.local = ~/devel/{below}
    bbssh.remote = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Mekk/{below:/=-}
    # … but there are overrides
    bbssh.keyring.local = ~/devel/mercurial/keyring
    bbssh.keyring.remote = ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/Mekk/mercurial_keyring

Of course I could achieve the same by defining ``bbssh`` among
``[paths]`` in ``~/devel/mercurial/keyring/.hg/hgrc`` file, but pattern
technique have some advantages:

- as I share and sync snippet of my ``~/.hgrc`` between machines, 
  this definition automatically propagates everywhere, and I don't need
  to remember about adding path to the new clone,

- it leaves all paths in one place where I can review them together,

- it can be expanded to whole subtree if necessary.

Keeping non-standard remote paths as patterns
-------------------------------------------------------

The same trick can be used for maintaining list of remotes.
For example here is my way to have ``hg pull official`` handy
in various tracked repositories::

    [path_pattern]
    official.hgstable.local = ~/tracked/hg-stable
    official.hgstable.remote = http://selenic.com/repo/hg-stable
    official.thg.local = ~/tracked/tortoise-hg
    official.thg.remote = https://bitbucket.org/tortoisehg/thg/
    # …

Of course I could enter those paths directly inside ``.hg/hgrc``, but
those definitions can be synced between machines, and survive 
in case I discard the repo in charge for some time.

Separating (and sharing) pattern configuration
---------------------------------------------------

In case the pattern list grows bigger, I recommend moving patterns
into the separate config file. For example, write in ``~/.hgrc``::

    %include ~/configs/mercurial/path_pattern.hgrc

and then store all patterns in ``path_pattern.hgrc``::

   [path_pattern]
   …

Extra benefit of such approach is that it makes sharing the file
easier (in my case ``~/configs/mercurial`` is by itself Mercurial
repository which I share over my various development machines, and
which contains all non-machine specific snippets of my Mercurial
configuration).


Installation
=======================================================

Linux/Unix (from PyPI)
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have working ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::

    pip install --user mercurial_path_pattern

or maybe::

    sudo pip install mercurial_path_pattern

(or use ``easy_install`` instead of ``pip``). Then activate by::

    [extensions]
    mercurial_path_pattern =

To upgrade, repeat the same command with ``--upgrade`` option, for
example::

    pip install --user --upgrade mercurial_path_pattern

Linux/Unix (from source)
-------------------------------------------------------

If you don't have ``pip``, or wish to follow development more closely:

- clone both this repository and `mercurial_extension_utils`_ and put
  them in the same directory, for example::

    cd ~/sources
    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-path_pattern/

- update to newest tags,

- activate by::

    [extensions]
    mercurial_path_pattern = ~/sources/mercurial-path_pattern/mercurial_path_pattern.py

To upgrade, pull and update.

Note that directory names matter. See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ for
longer description of this kind of installation.

Windows
-------------------------------------------------------

If you have any Python installed, you may install with ``pip``::

    pip install mercurial_path_pattern

Still, as Mercurial (whether taken from TortoiseHg_, or own package)
uses it's own bundled Python, you must activate by specifying the path::

    [extensions]
    mercurial_path_pattern = C:/Python27/Lib/site-packages/mercurial_path_pattern.py
    ;; Or wherever pip installed it

To upgrade to new version::

    pip --upgrade mercurial_path_pattern

If you don't have any Python, clone repositories::

    cd c:\hgplugins
    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-extension_utils/
    hg clone https://foss.heptapod.net/mercurial/mercurial-path_pattern/

update to tagged versions and activate by path::

    [extensions]
    mercurial_path_pattern = C:/hgplugins/mercurial-path_pattern/mercurial_path_pattern.py
    ;; Or wherever you cloned

See `mercurial_extension_utils`_ documentation for more details on
Windows installation. 

.. note::

   Directory names matter. If ``mercurial_path_pattern.py`` can't find
   ``mercurial_extension_utils.py`` in system path, it looks for it in
   its own directory, in ``../mercurial_extension_utils``, and in
   ``../extension_utils``.


Related extensions
=======================================================

`Schemes Extension`_, distributed together with Mercurial, makes it
possible to simplify repository URLs. For example, you can write::

    hg clone bb://Mekk/mercurial-path_pattern

(``bb`` is schemes alias expanding to BitBucket url).

While both Path Pattern and Schemes are related to path management,
they target different habits. Schemes is particularly useful
for people making frequent ad-hoc clones, Path Pattern is about
keeping consistent synchronized repository hierarchies. With Schemes,
urls you type are shorter and less error-prone, with Path Pattern
you don't type them at all as Mercurial guesses them for you.

Both can cooperate, schemes aliases can be used in pattern definitions::

    [path_pattern]
    bitb.local = ~/sources/{below}
    bitb.remote = bb://Mekk/{below:/=-}

will work (as long as schemes extension is enabled).
