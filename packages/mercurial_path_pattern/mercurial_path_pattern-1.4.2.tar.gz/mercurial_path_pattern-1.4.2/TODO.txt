Functional
===========

→ Possibility to define path aliases. For example „let default=dom”

→ Detect and handle cases where a few patterns match current repo
  (pick longest .local). Example: ~/sources have some rule,
  ~/sources/archived another

→ Allow {1}, {2} etc instead of names

→ clonefrom ?  [ either clone all missing, or give short name ]
   { Note: it works to      hg init;   hg pull lagrange }


Technical
===========

→ Maybe use ui.expandpath("alias") instead of analysing paths section
