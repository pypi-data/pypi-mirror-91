        Extended groups management for Plone
        
        This package contains some additional groups management pages and a simple
        feature for scheduled activation and termination of group memberships,
        using a few tables in a PostgreSQL database
        (with currently hardcoded names).
        
        The purpose of this package (for now) is *not* to provide new functionality
        but to factor out existing functionality from an existing monolitic Zope product.
        Thus, it is more likely to lose functionality during further development
        (as parts of it will be forked out into their own packages,
        or some functionality may even become obsolete because there are better
        alternatives in standard Plone components).
        
        The additional fields for groups are not (yet) part of this package.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Group administration pages 
        - A very simple bulletin board for the group members
        - A simple scheduler for group memberships
        
        
        Examples

        Changelog
        =========
        
        
        1.2.1 (2021-01-12)
        ------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - Use Javascript API functions (Unitracc.*)
        - moved ``group-desktop.js`` here, from visaplan.UnitraccResource
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.2.0 (2020-12-16)
        ------------------
        
        Breaking changes:
        
        - `crumbs` modules renamed to `oldcrumbs`
        
          (With zope.deprecation_ installed, imports will continue to work;
          a DeprecationWarning will be logged.)
        
        Requirements removed:
        
        - visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs_ (still supported; hard requirement removed)
        - visaplan.plone.sqlwrapper_
          (An SQLWrapper class with that very functionality is alternatively implemented
          by the visaplan.zope.reldb_.legacy module)
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Don't include the (now) non-required packages in the configure.zcml anymore:
        
          - visaplan.plone.breadcrumbs_
          - visaplan.kitchen_

        1.1.6 (2020-08-20)
        ------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - Python 3 compatibility, using six_
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.5 (2020-08-03)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Switch to group desktop via group selection didn't work.
        - Access codes page now linked absolutely, and thus works now even if
          the desktop was loaded via AJAX.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.4 (2020-06-12)
        ------------------
        
        New Features:
        
        - On the desktop, list unbooked but accessable courses (e.g. demo courses, "for authenticated" / "for all")
          after the booked courses (and without statistics, of course).
          This is so far considered too tiny to rectify a "minor" version change.
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - Switched off the disfunctional personal calendar
          (more precisely: removed the section from the desktop)
          which crashed when clicked (#50)
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.3 (2020-04-08)
        ------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - Don't use the course titles for a link to the course anymore;
          we have "Start course" and "Continue course" for this purpose
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.2 (2020-03-27)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfix:
        
        - ``group-desktop.pt`` now loads correctly via AJAX
          (including the DataTable; a minor layout problem remains)
        - To `start` course via desktop link (rather than continueing),
          specify ``uid=1`` explicitly;
          this is currently necessary to make the AJAX load work.
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.0.1 (2020-03-24)
        --------------------
        
        Miscellaneous:
        
        - New SQL script ``src/visaplan/plone/groups/groupsharing/sql/update-0003.sql``:
          modifies the SQL view ``course_statistics_overview`` to always report
          ``course_view`` as the (last used) ``page_view_type``
          (to load that page via AJAX; #393)
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.1.0 (2020-03-06)
        ------------------
        
        New features:
        
        - Views for AJAX navigation (registered if visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_ is installed)
        - ``group-desktop`` views
          (for full-page and - not yet used with visaplan.plone.ajaxnavigation_ v1.0 -
          for AJAX loading;
          {my,our}-{images,...} views currently linked with data-fullpage-only attributes)
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.2 (2019-05-13)
        ------------------
        
        Bugfixes:
        
        - Fixed incomplete conversion of Tomcom adapters usage to ``getToolByName``
        
        [tobiasherp]
        
        
        1.0.1 (2019-05-09)
        ------------------
        
        Note: Due to a regression, please proceed to version 1.0.2!
        
        - New functions ``utils.generate_{structure,course}_group_ids``,
          ``generate_structure_group_tuples``
        
        - Support for option ``resolve_role`` for the following functions:
        
          - ``split_group_id``
          - ``generate_structure_group_tuples``
        
          With ``resolve_role=True``, these functions tell a role a role, and a
          suffix a suffix; e.g., the ``Author`` group of structures is not given the
          ``Author`` but the ``Editor`` local role.
        
          For now, the default value for ``resolve_role`` is *False*;
          this may change in future versions.
