Several components of magLabUtilities (such as magLabUtilities.uiutilities.plotting.hysteresis) use
an instance of the Matlab engine for Python for things like creating plots. The Matlab engine for 
Python is not installable with Pip, as it is proprietary software which requires Matlab to be installed.
Therefore, the Matlab engine for Python must be manually configured if any functions requiring it are
desired.

Requirements:
    - An installed version of Matlab
    - Python 2.7, 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8 (More versions may work, but these are the versions listed in the link above.)

1. Open CMD as Administrator (right-click on CMD)
2. >cd matlabroot\extern\engines\python (matlabroot is obtained by typing 'matlabroot' into the terminal inside Matlab.)
3. >python setup.py install

Note that if the user is running magLabUtilities inside a virtual environment, setup.py must be run using
this virtual environment.
