# song-and-spell

### tl;dr

A key-logger that triggers playing an audio track when a sequence of keys are pressed and  a web-app to configure the words and songs.

Requires VLC to be installed on the host and an X server to be running.

### install on raspberry-pi 400

##### With a screen attached
We need to force the  X-server to start when the HDMI cable is not plugged in (for the pynput key-logger). The easiest way I found is to run `sudo raspi-config`, then select Advanced, Screen and pick any screen resolution except for the default one.

Pair, trust and connect your bluetooth speaker. There are many guides for this,  [here is one](https://raspberrydiy.com/connect-raspberry-pi-bluetooth-speaker/).

To install the app, add a systemd-service so that it starts on start-up  and make some other changes so that it can headlessly connect to a bluetooth speaker, download and install the [install script](/scripts/install_rpi.sh) on your raspberry-pi 400. In a terminal:

**Note: this script will only work on a raspberry-pi (or any debian-derived OS with a bluetooth transciever and a normal user `pi` that is in the audio and bluetooth groups).**

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cboddy/song-and-spell/master/scripts/install_rpi.sh | sudo bash
```

Note: this will restart your raspberry-pi. Turn on your speaker and it should automatically connect and go to the web-ui running on port 5000. It should look like the image below.

### todo 
* ~~volume-normalisation?~~

### notes
* the pynput library requires an X server to be running. Set default resolution in `raspi-config` (anything other than default) to force the X server to start. 

### development

```
python3 -m venv
. bin/venv/activate
python3 setup.py develop
```
