    Kayobe configures Bifrost to use the ``trusted`` zone of ``firewalld``,
    ensuring that all services running on the seed host are accessible.
    Deployments with stricter firewall policies can select another zone by
    setting the ``kolla_bifrost_firewalld_internal_zone`` variable in
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/bifrost.yml``. To avoid loss of connectivity to the
    seed host, ensure that ``firewalld`` is already configured on the seed host
    before deploying seed services.
fixes:
  - |
    Fixes loss of connectivity to the seed host after deploying seed services,
    when using a shared provisioning and admin network. This was caused by
    Bifrost configuring ``firewalld`` to only allow Ironic traffic. Kayobe now
    configures Bifrost to use the ``trusted`` zone, which allows all traffic.
