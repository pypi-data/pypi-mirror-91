    Adds support for plugging the Open vSwitch provider bridge directly into a
    an Ethernet interface. Previously it was necessary to define a Linux
    bridge, into which Kayobe would plug a virtual Ethernet pair. The use of a
    direct connection may provide improved performance, or allow additional
    hardware offloading. See `story 2007364
