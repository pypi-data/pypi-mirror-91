features:
  - |
    Adds two new configuration variables, ``kolla_bifrost_inspection_timeout``
    and ``inspector_inspection_timeout``, which allow to customise timeouts of
    hardware inspection (in seconds) respectively for overcloud nodes and
    baremetal compute nodes. ``inspector_inspection_timeout`` defaults to
    ``1200`` and ``kolla_bifrost_inspection_timeout`` defaults to the value of
    ``inspector_inspection_timeout``. See `story 2007844
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007844>`__ for details.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default timeout for the overcloud hardware inspection operation is
    increased from 10 minutes to 20 minutes, to avoid issues when using the
    ``extra-hardware`` collector on hardware booting slowly.
