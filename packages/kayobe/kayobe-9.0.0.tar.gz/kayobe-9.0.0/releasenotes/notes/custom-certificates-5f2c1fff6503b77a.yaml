features:
  - |
    Adds support for passing custom TLS certificates to Kolla Ansible via
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla/certificates/``. See `story 2007679
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007679>`__ for details.
upgrade:
  - |
    Reverts to use the Kolla Ansible default value for
    ``kolla_external_fqdn_cert`` and ``kolla_internal_fqdn_cert`` when
    ``kolla_external_tls_cert`` and ``kolla_internal_tls_cert`` are
    respectively not set. This allows for the standard Kolla Ansible
    configuration approach of dropping these certificates into the
    ``$KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH/kolla/certificates`` directory, rather than defining
    them as variables. This can be useful if using the ``kolla-ansible
    certificates`` command to generate certificates for testing.
