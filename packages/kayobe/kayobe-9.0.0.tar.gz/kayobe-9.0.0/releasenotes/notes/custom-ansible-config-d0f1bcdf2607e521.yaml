    Adds support for providing custom Ansible configuration files via Kayobe
    configuration. For Kayobe the file should be located at
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/ansible.cfg``. For Kolla Ansible, it may be located
    either at ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/kolla/ansible.cfg`` or
    ``${KAYOBE_CONFIG_PATH}/ansible.cfg``. A file specified via the
    ``ANSIBLE_CONFIG`` environment variable overrides these.
