    Changes Ironic Python Agent (IPA) image builds to use `IPA builder
    <https://docs.openstack.org/ironic-python-agent-builder/latest/>`__.
    The following variables have been added to configure the IPA builder source
    location: ``ipa_builder_source_url``, ``ipa_builder_source_version``. See
    `story 2007070 <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007070>`__ for
    details.
  - |
    Adds new variables to allow extension of the list of Disk Image Builder
    (DIB) git repositories available when building Ironic Python Agent (IPA)
    images: ``ipa_build_dib_git_elements_default`` and
    ``ipa_build_dib_git_elements_extra``. The existing
    ``ipa_build_dib_git_elements`` variable is a concatenation of these.
    By default there is now one git repository configured for IPA builder, and
    use of ``ipa_build_dib_git_elements`` should typically be replaced with
    ``ipa_build_dib_git_elements_extra`` to avoid losing this default.

    The file extension used for the Ironic Python Agent (IPA) kernel image has
    changed from ``vmlinuz`` to ``kernel``, in line with upstream changes in
    Ironic. This affects both Bifrost running on the seed and Ironic running in
    the overcloud for bare metal compute. If building images locally, this
    should be done prior to upgrading services.
