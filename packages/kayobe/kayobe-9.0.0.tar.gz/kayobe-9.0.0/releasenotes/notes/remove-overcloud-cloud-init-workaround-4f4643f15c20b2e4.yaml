    Removes the workaround for using a tagged VLAN as the admin network
    interface on overcloud hosts. This was necessary for CentOS 7.5 which
    shipped an old version of ``cloud-init``. The variables
    ``overcloud_host_image_workaround_cloud_init_enabled`` and
    ``overcloud_host_image_workaround_cloud_init_repo`` have been removed.
