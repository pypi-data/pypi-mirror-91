features:
  - |
    Adds ``controller_network_host_default_network_interfaces`` and
    ``controller_network_host_extra_network_interfaces`` variables which define
    the networks to which separate network hosts are attached.
upgrade:
  - |
    The default value of ``controller_network_host_network_interfaces`` is now
    the combination of unique networks listed in new variables named
    ``controller_network_host_default_network_interfaces`` and
    ``controller_network_host_extra_network_interfaces``. As a result
    ``controller_network_host_network_interfaces`` now contains the following
    additional networks: overcloud admin network, internal network and storage
    network. See :kayobe-doc:`network configuration of network hosts
    <configuration/network.html#network-hosts>` for more details.
fixes:
  - |
    The default value for ``controller_network_host_network_interfaces``
    was updated to connect network hosts to all their required networks.
