    Removes the ``seed_hypervisor_libvirt_pool_capacity`` variable, which was
    passed to Libvirt through the libvirt-host role when creating a storage
    pool. This information is actually ignored by Libvirt, which gathers
    capacity and other metadata from the storage backend. See `story 2007381
    <https://storyboard.openstack.org/#!/story/2007381>`__ for details.
