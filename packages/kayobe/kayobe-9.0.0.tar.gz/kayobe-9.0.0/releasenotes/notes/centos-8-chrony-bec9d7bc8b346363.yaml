    Support for configuring an NTP daemon on the seed, seed hypervisor and
    overcloud hosts is no longer present, as appropriate packages are not
    available for CentOS 8.  Instead, Kolla Ansible is configured to deploy the
    ``chrony`` container on overcloud hosts by default. This may be disabled by
    setting ``kolla_enable_chrony`` to ``false``. There is no support for
    running a ``chrony`` container on the seed or seed hypervisor hosts.
