        ## Install
        ```
        pip install supervisor-discord
        ```
        
        ## Configure
        Either run `supervisor-discord -s`, or create config.yaml manually.
        
        config.yaml can be in one of two locations, `/etc/supervisordiscord/config.yaml` or the location where site-packages are installed on your system.
        
        ```
        example: # process name
          alerts: # list of process states that can trigger this message
          - STARTING
          - RUNNING
          - BACKOFF
          - STOPPING
          - FATAL
          - EXITED
          - STOPPED
          - UNKNOWN
          message_format: '{{process_name}} changed to state {{to_state}}'
          webhookURL: # discord webhook url
         ```
         repeat for each process.
         
        `message_format` supports [strftime](https://strftime.org/) and the following formats:  
        ```
        {{process_name}}, {{from_state}}, {{to_state}}
        ```
        
        ## Supervisor.conf
        Ensure that supervisor-discord is on your system `PATH`.
        ```
        [eventlistener:supervisor-discord]
        command=supervisor-discord
        events=PROCESS_STATE
        ```
