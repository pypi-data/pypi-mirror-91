# NinjaRMMPy

## What is this repository for?

Unoffical [NinjaRMM API v2](https://app.ninjarmm.com/apidocs/) client for Python.

Inspired by [py-ninjarmm-api-client](https://pypi.org/project/py-ninjarmm-api-client/)

This library is currently not yet finished.

### Note

`ninjarmmpy` versions `0.2` and higher use the function names as named in the
NinjaRMM documentation. This is a breaking change from past versions.

If you are not yet able to update your function calls to use the new function names,
then you should continue to use version `0.1.1a`.
