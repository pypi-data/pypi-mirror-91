# iGenius Adapters SDK

This is the Software Development Kit for iGenius Web Connectors development.  
You can use our SDK in your project to be able to handle correctly the data structures that will be used by iGenius services to call your web connector adapter.

## Introduction

### Folder structure

Our SDK has the main objective to expose our data structures that are the business objects of our application: we call them `Entities` and thet are included in a package with the same name.

```bash
-- src
   |- igenius_adapters_sdk
      |- entities
```

### Data structure

Our datasource adapters system is based on a relational database structure, so our `entities` are a mapping of this kind of data organisation.

## Install

With Poetry

```bash
poetry add igenius-adapters-sdk
```

With pip

```bash
pip install igenius-adapters-sdk
```
