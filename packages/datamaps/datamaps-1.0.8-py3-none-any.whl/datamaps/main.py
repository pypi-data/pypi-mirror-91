    BASICS

    Import data from the template files stored in the input directory to create
    a master.xlsx file in the output directory.

    The default datamap file will be used unless you pass the -d flag with a path to a different file.

    TEMPLATE ROW LIMIT

    By default there is a row limit of 500 when importing from a template, which means only cells in
    rows 1-500 will be imported, no matter what your datamap says. This prevents datamaps running out of
    memory when faced with a spreadsheet containing errenous/invisible rows, which can occur without the
    user being aware, particularly on templates that have been subjected to length edits, years of copy
    and pasting, styling changes and other similar chronic abuse.

    This value can be changed in the configuration file (change the value for
    TEMPLATE_ROW_LIMIT). There may be an imperceptible performance improvement gained by reducing this
    value to as low as possible, but its primary purpose is to prevent fatal memory leaks when
    processing a problematic file.
