Description: # scanprep â€“ Prepare scanned PDF documents
        
        > Small utility to prepare scanned documents. Supports separating PDF files by separator pages and removing blank pages.
        
        <!-- TODO: GIF showing how to use scanprep -->
        
        Scanprep can be used to prepare scanned documents for further processing with existing tools (like the great [OCRmyPDF](https://github.com/jbarlow83/OCRmyPDF)) or directly for archival. It allows splitting multiple documents that were scanned in a single batch into multiple files. In addition, it can also remove blank pages from the output (this is especially helpful if using a duplex scanner).
        
        For document separation, separator pages need to be inserted between the different documents before scanning. These pages tell the program where to split. You can either use the [included separator page](/separator-page.pdf) or create your own. The separator page simply needs to have a barcode that encodes the text `SCANPREP_SEP` (you can use any [barcode type supported by zbar](http://zbar.sourceforge.net/about.html)).
