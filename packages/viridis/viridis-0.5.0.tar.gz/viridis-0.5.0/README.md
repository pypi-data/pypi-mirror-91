Viridis is a Python library for tree data and algorithms. It is named
after _Morelia viridis_, the green tree python. It is compatible with and tested
with 100% coverage on Python 3.5.

It is based on the excellent NetworkX graph library.

Initially, viridis only implements ultrametric trees and associated functions.
