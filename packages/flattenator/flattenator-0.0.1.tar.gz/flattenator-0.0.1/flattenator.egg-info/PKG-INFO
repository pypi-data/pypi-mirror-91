Description: # Flattenator
        
        Flattenator takes a layered Docker image as input, and replaces it with a
        flattened single-layer image as output, preserving metadata in so far as
        possible.
        
        ## Operation
        
        Flattenator must be invoked from a machine with Python 3 (and click)
        installed, and docker must be in the `PATH`.  Further, `docker login`
        must have already been run to allow the running user to push an image.
        
        Flattenator will download the image requested, push that image with the
        tag `exp_{tag}_layered` (so as not to destroy the initial image),
        flatten the image, and then push the flattened image under both the
        original tag and `exp_{tag}_flattened`.
