    "In microwave measurements,  one commonly needs to measure a n-port deveice  with a m-port network analyzer ($ m<n $ of course). Generally, this is done by  terminating each non-measured port with a matched load, and assuming the reflected power is negligable. However, in some cases this may not provide the most accurate results, or even be possible in all measurement environments. The paper above presents an elegent solution to this problem, using impedance renormalization. We'll call it *Tippet's technique*, because it has a good ring to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In *Tippets technique*, several sub-networks are measured in a similar way as before, but the port terminations are not assumed to be matched. Instead, the terminations just have to be known and no more than one can be completely reflective. So, in general $|\\Gamma| \\ne 1$. During measurements, each port is terminated with a consistent termination. So port 1 is always terminated with $Z_1$ when not being measured. Once measured, each sub-network is re-normalized to these port impedances. Think about that.  Finally the composit network is contructed, and  may then be re-normalized to the desired system impedance, say $50 ohm $ \n",
