collective.searchandreplace Installation
========================================

collective.searchandreplace is designed to be used with Plone 4 and can be installed as follows:

 * Add ``collective.searchandreplace`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
 
    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        collective.searchandreplace
        
  * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
  
    [instance]
    recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
    ...
    zcml =
        collective.searchandreplace
        
  * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
  
    $ ./bin/buildout
        
You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
from another package's configure.zcml file.
