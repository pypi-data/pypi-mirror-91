description = This library contains various utils to parse GitHub repositories into function definition and docstring pairs. It is based on tree-sitter to parse code into ASTs and apply heuristics to parse metadata in more details. Currently, it supports 6 languages: Python, Java, Go, Php, Ruby, and Javascript. It also parses function calls and links them with their definitions for Python.
