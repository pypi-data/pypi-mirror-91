I think BMC Bioinformatics is probably what I should be aiming for.  But I 
might at least try submitting to Bioinformatics or PLOS Comp Biol, which I 
think are as high as I could realistically target.

Bioinfomatics
=============
Impact factor: 4.5
Article type: Application Note
  
  Applications Notes are short descriptions of novel software or new algorithm 
  implementations, databases and network services (web servers, and 
  interfaces).  Software or data must be freely available to non-commercial 
  users.  Availability and Implementation must be clearly stated in the 
  article. Authors must also ensure that the software is available for a full 
  two years following publication. Web services must not require mandatory 
  registration by the user.  Additional supplementary data can be published 
  online-only by the journal.  This supplementary material should be referred 
  to in the abstract of the Application Note. If describing software, the 
  software should run under nearly all conditions on a wide range of machines.  
  Web servers should not be browser specific. Application Notes must not 
  describe trivial utilities, nor involve significant investment of time for 
  the user to install. The name of the application should be included in the 
  title.

Criteria:

Examples:

- https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/bth271

- Not a lot of recent examples...

PLOS Computational Biology
==========================
Impact factor: 4.4
Article type: Software articles

  https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002799

  The idea of free reuse, redistribution, and modification of scientific 
  software is at the core of the PLOS Computational Biology Software Section.  
  For a manuscript to be published as a Software Article, we require that all 
  software use a license approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI). OSI's 
  approval criteria (http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd) ensure transparency, 
  reproducibility, and if applied to scientific software, push science forward 
  by allowing researchers to build on existing work. Scientifically, we require 
  that the article has been shown to provide new biological insights and are 
  not only just incremental improvements over existing approaches. All articles 
  require a presubmission inquiry. For a detailed description of all criteria 
  see http://www.ploscompbiol.org/static/guidelines.action#software.

Criteria:

[ ] PLOS Computational Biology publishes articles describing outstanding open 
    source software of exceptional importance that has been shown to provide 
    new biological insights, either as a part of the software article, or 
    published elsewhere.

    - No biological insights...
    - But the example below doesn't seem to have biological insights either 
      (from the title).  I should read it more closely.

[x] The software must already be widely adopted, or have the promise of wide 
    adoption by a broad community of users.

[x] The software must be downloadable anonymously in source code form and 
    licensed under an Open Source Initiative (OSI) compliant license.

[x] The source code must be accompanied with documentation on building and 
    installing the software from source, as well as for using the software, 
    including instructions on how a user can test the software on supplied test 
    data.

[x] Software articles require a cover letter that includes explanations on how 
    the above criteria are met.

Examples:

- https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007696

Notes:

- Might be a bit lacking in terms of "new biological insights".

Computer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine
============================================
Impact factor: 3.4
Article type: Systems and programs

  In addition to papers describing software related to the methodology section 
  above, papers on biomedical computer applications, original from the point of 
  view of theoretical or technological approach, or describing the adaptation 
  of existing software to the solution of specific problems, may be considered. 
  No restrictions are made on the use of computer languages; the description 
  and exchange of software widely applied in biomedical research and medical 
  practice is considered of most importance. Papers on programs intended for 
  Section II should cover the following items: (i) Introduction; (ii) 
  Computational methods and theory; (iii) System or program description, 
  preferably with structograms, or block diagrams and flow charts; (iv) Samples 
  of typical system or program runs; (v) Hardware and software specifications; 
  (vi) Mode of availability of the system or program; clear information is 
  required; (vii) Listing of literature in order of citation in the text; 
  (viii) Appendix expanding, when necessary, material in the text.

Examples:

BMC Bioinformatics
==================
Impact factor: 2.5
Article type: Software article
Aims and scope:

  BMC Bioinformatics is an open access, peer-reviewed journal  that considers 
  articles on all aspects of the development, testing and novel application of 
  computational and statistical methods for the modeling and analysis of all 
  kinds of biological data, as well as other areas of computational biology.

  Software articles should describe a tool likely to be of broad utility that 
  represents a significant advance over previously published software (usually 
  demonstrated by direct comparison with available related software).

Examples:

- SNPFile â€“ A software library and file format for large scale association 
  mapping and population genetics studies
- A simple spreadsheet-based, MIAME-supportive format for microarray data: 
  MAGE-TAB
- An intuitive Python interface for Bioconductor libraries demonstrates the 
  utility of language translators

Source Code for Biology and Medicine
====================================
CiteScore: 1.1

Journal of Open Source Software
===============================
Pros:
- Seems like it would be the least time commitment.

Cons:
- Don't think many people read it.
