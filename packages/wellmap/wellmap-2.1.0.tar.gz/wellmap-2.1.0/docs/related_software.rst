There are a handful of other packages that may be helpful when working with 
microplate experiments.  The most noteworthy is plater_, which defines a 
CSV-based file format to describe plate layouts.  The TOML-based :mod:`wellmap` 
file format has several advantages, though, including:

- Less redundant.
- Easier to read.
- Easier to write.
- Includes a tool for visualizing plate layouts.
