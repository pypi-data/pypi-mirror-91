'''
Contains `threading.Thread` subclass that saves the result of a thread
as its `result` attribute - i.e. call `thread_with_result_instance_1.result`
after `thread_with_result_instance_1` finishes running to get the return
value from the function that ran on that thread.

import threading

class ThreadWithResult(threading.Thread):
    '''
    Simple subclass wrapper around `threading.Thread` to get the return value
    from a thread in python (from `threading` built-in package in
    Python Standard library). Exact same interface for creating an instance
    of this threading sublcass as `threading.Thread`! For details about
    the interface features available from `threading.Thread`,
    see documentation under "Method resolution order" - accessible
    from python interpreter with:
    help(ThreadWithResult)

    Helper class used solely for saving the result of a function called
    through the threading interface, since `some_thread_object.start()`
    executes and returns immediately, without waiting for the thread
    to finish. The name of the function to run on a separate thread
    should be passed in through the `target` argument, and any
    arguments for the function should be passed in through the
    `args` argument.

    EXPLANATION:

    We create a closure function that runs the actual function we want
    to run on a separate thread and enclose the function passed to
    `target` inside the closure function, and pass the CLOSURE FUNCTION
    as the function to the `target` argument for `threading.Thread`.

    Since the function we want to run on a separate thread is no longer
    the function passed directly to `threading.Thread` (remember
    we pass the closure function instead!), we save the result of
    the enclosed function as the `self.failed` attribute for the
    actual instance of this class.

    We use inheritance to initialize this instance with the
    closure function as the `target` function and no arguments
    for `args` since we pass the arguments to our actual function
    inside the closure function.

            self.result = target(*args, **kwargs)
        super().__init__(group=group, target=function, name=name, daemon=daemon)
