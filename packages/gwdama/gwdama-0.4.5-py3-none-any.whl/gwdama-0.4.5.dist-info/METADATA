This package aims at providing a unified and easy to use interface to access Gravitational Wave (GW) data and output some *well organised* datasets, ready to be used for Machine Learning projects or Data Analys purposes (source properties, noise studies, etc.).

===========================
 Data Preparation Workflow
===========================

The typical use case of this package concerns data preparation and can be viewed, in a *pipeline*, as the preliminary stage for Data Analysis. Although it is primarily meant for GW analyses, it is built to be sufficiently general to handle any data type. The basic workflow that can be implemented is the following:

1. **Data acquisition**: Data from GW detectors can be read from different locations, such as from *local* `frame files (gwf) <https://lappweb.in2p3.fr/virgo/FrameL/>`_, or from datasets previously saved with it, and especially from the `Gravitational Wave Open Science Center <https://www.gw-openscience.org/>`_ (GWOSC).

2. **Organisation into groups**: Various *acquisition channels*, data *epochs*, or preliminary preprocessing operations, can be organised in a hierarchical way in various `groups nad subgroups <http://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/groups.html>`_, each containing their own metadata;

3. **Data preparation/preprocessing**: Along with the original "raw" data, one can perform several pre-processing operations and data manipulations, included in this package, in order to make the dataset ready for the following Data Analysis stage of the pipeline. This processed data is conveniently organised into new groups, and the "raw" ones can be removed to save memory;

4. **Reading and Writing**: Once the dataset for a specific task has been created, this can be saved to disk into `hdf5 format <https://www.hdfgroup.org/solutions/hdf5/>`_, preserving all the hierarchical group and sub-group structure and the metadata. This can be read back by **GWdama** for further data manipulation and preparation.


==================================
 GW data manager package overview
==================================

**GWdama** currently comprises the main class **GwDataManager**, which behaves as a multi-purpose and multi-format container for data, which is based on `h5py.File class <http://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/file.html>`_ with the addition of the methods and the attributes to import and manipulate GW data. Differently from the common application of ``h5py.File`` objects, a ``GwDataManager`` instance is, by default, set to occupy only a temporary file, which is authomatically deleted by python once closed, or some space in the RAM. Refer to the `full documentation <'https://gwdama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'>`_ for further details. 

Inside ``GwDataManager`` objects, data is stored into `h5py.Dataset like <http://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/dataset.html>`_ objects organised into a hierarchical structure of `h5py.Groups <http://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/high/group.html>`_ and sub-groups. These Datasets are created within an instance of ``GwDataManager()`` with the usual methods of ``h5py``: ``create_dataset(name, shape, dtype)``. They contain data, typically of numeric type, and some attributes (or metadata). For example, for GW data, and in general all time series, it is important the information of when they have been recorded, and at which sampling frequency. A neme and a unit are also useful. These can be conveniently added and customised. Also a ``GwDatamanager`` object contains attributes for itself. 

--------------
 Installation
--------------

**gwdama** can be installed via `pip <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install gwdama

and requires Python 3.6.0 or higher. The previous command automatically fulfils all the required dependencies (like on ``numpy``, ``matplotlib``), so you are ready to start generating datasets and making plots.

Further details can be found in the `full documentation <'https://gwdama.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html'>`_.


--------------------
 Creating a dataset
--------------------

A dataset of, say, random numbers can be readily created as::

    >>> from gwdama.io import GwDataManager
    >>> import numpy as np

    >>> dama = GwDataManager("my_dama")
    >>> dama.create_dataset('random_n', data=np.random.normal(0, 1, (10,)))
    >>> dama.create_dataset('a_list', data=[1, 2, 3, 4])
    >>> dama.create_dataset('a_string', data="this is a string")

The *string representation* of the ``GwDataManager`` class provides a quick look at its structure and its attributes. You can call it with the method ``__str__()`` or simply by printing the object::

    >>> print(dama)
    my_dama:
      ├── a_list
      ├── a_string
      └── random_n

      Attributes:
         dama_name : my_dama
        time_stamp : 20-07-28_19h36m47s

Other attributes can be added to both the ``GwDataManager`` object and the Datasets therein::

    >>> dama.attrs['owner'] = 'Francesco'  # The new attribute "owner" is added with value "Francesco"
    >>> dama.show_attrs
    my_dama:
      ├── a_list
      ├── a_string
      └── random_n

      Attributes:
         dama_name : my_dama
             owner : Francesco
        time_stamp : 20-07-28_19h36m47s  

Datasets can be accessed from their *keys*, as reported in the structure shown above, with a syntax similar to that for dictionaries in Python::

    >>> dset = dama['random_n']      # 'random_n' is the dataset key
    >>> dset.attrs['t0'] = 0         # It is conveninet to use gps times
    >>> dset.attrs['fsample'] = 10   # measured in Hz

    >>> dset.show_attrs
    fsample : 10
         t0 : 0

To get the data contained in this dataset, call its attribute ``data``:
::

    >>> dset.data
    array([-0.73796689, -1.34206706, -0.97898291, -0.19846702,
           -0.85056961,  0.20206334,  0.84720009,  0.19527366,
           -0.9246727 , -0.04808732])

------------------------------
 Writing and reading datasets
------------------------------

Now it is time to *write your data* to disc. Let's say we want to store the information contained in our ``GwdataManager`` object into the `hdf5 file <https://www.hdfgroup.org/>`_ ``out_dataset.h5``:
::

    >>> out_f = 'out_dataset.h5'
    >>> write_gwdama_dataset(out_f)

Then remember to **close your previous file** before leaving the session:
::

    >>> dama.close()
    >>> del dama       # Redundant but usefull

.. note:: This operation is automatically performed every time the session is closed. However, it is good practice to do this manually every time there is no more need of a certain variable.

To *read back* your data::

    >>> new_dama = GwDataManager(out_f)  # Same namse as the line above
    Reading dama
    >>> print(new_dama)
    my_dama:
      ├── a_list
      ├── a_string
      └── random_n

      Attributes:
         dama_name : my_dama
             owner : Francesco
        time_stamp : 20-07-30_12h19m32s



----------------
 Read open data 
----------------

Open data can be accessed from both online and local virtual disks provided by `CVMFS <https://cernvm.cern.ch/fs/>`_. 

From online GWOSC
-----------------
GW strain data can be read by means of the ``.read_gwdata()`` method. This basically takes as input an interval of time, which can be provided as a ``float`` in gps units or in UTC, in a human readible format (see next example), besides the label of the detector (``H1``, ``L1`` or ``V1``):
::

    >>> event_gps = 1186746618                                      # GW170814
    >>> dama = GwDataManager()                                      # Default name 'mydama' assigned
    >>> dama.read_gwdata(event_gps - 50, event_gps +10, ifo='L1',   # Required params
                         m_data_source="gwosc-remote",              # data source
                         dts_key='online')                          # group key (optional, but useful)


From local CVMFS
----------------

CernVM-FS must be installed and configured on your computer. Refer to its `description on the GWOSC website <https://www.gw-openscience.org/cvmfs/>`_ 
or to `this Quick start guide <https://cernvm.cern.ch/portal/filesystem/quickstart>`_.

Assuming your data are stored at the following path (you can always modify it by passing it as a parameter to ``read_gwdata()``)::

   cvmfs_path = '/data2/cvmfs/gwosc.osgstorage.org/gwdata/' 

data can be read with:

::

    >>> start='2017-06-08 01:00:00'  # starting UTC time as a string
    >>> end='2017-06-08 02:00:00'    # ending time as a string
    >>> ifo='H1'                     # interfereometer tag

    >>> rate='4k'                    # sample rate: 4k or 16k
    >>> frmt='hdf5'                  # format of the data: gwf or hdf5

    >>> dama.read_gwdata(start, end, m_data_source="gwosc-cvmfs", ifo=ifo, m_data_format=frmt)
