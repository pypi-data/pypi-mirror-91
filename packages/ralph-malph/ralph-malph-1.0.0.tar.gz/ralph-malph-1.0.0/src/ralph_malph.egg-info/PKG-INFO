Description: # Ralph, a learning analytics processor to feed your LRS
        
        ## Getting started with development
        
        ### Core development
        
        To start playing with `ralph`, you should build it using the `bootstrap` Make target:
        
        ```
        $ make bootstrap
        ```
        
        Now you can start playing the CLI:
        
        ```
        $ bin/ralph --help
        ```
        
        To lint your code, either use the `lint` meta target or one of the linting tools we use:
        
        ```bash
        # Run all linters
        $ make lint
        
        # Run pylint
        $ make lint-pylint
        
        # List available linters
        $ make help | grep lint-
        ```
        
        To run tests on your code, either use the `test` Make target or the
        `bin/pytest` script to pass specific arguments to the test runner:
        
        ```bash
        # Run all tests
        $ make test
        
        # Run pytest with options
        $ bin/pytest -x -k mixins
        ```
        
        ### Tray development
        
        Ralph is distributed along with its tray (a deployable package for Kubernetes
        clusters using [Arnold](https://github.com/openfun/arnold)). If you intend to
        work on this tray, please refer to Arnold's documentation.
