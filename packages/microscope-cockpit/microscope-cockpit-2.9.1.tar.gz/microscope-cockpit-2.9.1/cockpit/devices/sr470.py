""" Cockpit device for SRS SR470 shutter controller.

This is a really simple driver for the SR470 shutter controller.  For now, all
it does is make the SR470 respond to an external trigger, although it is
feasible that the shutter controller could be programmed to control exposure
timing.

Sample config entry:
  [561nm shutter]
  type: StanfordShutter
  ipAddress: 192.168.0.10
  port: 5024
  lights: 561nm
  triggerSource: dsp
  triggerLine: 3

  [dsp]
  type: LegacyDSP
  ...
