""" A dummy analogue client device.

An analogue client is some device that is driven by a voltage
from an analogue source. The analogue source device is responsible
for setting output voltages and running sweeps. Previously, handling
of certain analogue devices was hard coded into executor devices, like
the DSP, but this lacks flexibility. Instead, we need some intermediate
handler so that the control of the client devices is clearer in experiments.

An analogue client:
 * registers itself with an analogue source
 * offers a GenericPositioner handler
The GenericPositioner will appear in experiment ActionTables, but
the analogue source will be responsible for executing those lines
in the table. Historically, there were to types of analogue devices used
in experiments.
 i)  those that the experiment moves through a continuous range, such as
     piezo devices;
 ii) those that the experiment moves through indexed positions.
In the latter case, indexed positions were often hard coded into the
analogue *source device* code. Again, this lacks flexibility, and thoroughly
breaks an abstracted, modular device model. Now, indexed positions are stored
on the client device, and experiments will only ever move devices to positions
within their continuous range - i.e., the experiment will look up positions
from those stored on the device, and insert those into the action table rather
than the index.
