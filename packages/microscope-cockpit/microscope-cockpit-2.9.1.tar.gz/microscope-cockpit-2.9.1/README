Cockpit is a microscope graphical user interface.  It is a flexible
and easy to extend platform aimed at life scientists using bespoke
microscopes.  Its main features are:

- Easy to use and extend by life scientists.  Cockpit is completely
  written in Python and meant to be extended by the user.

- Independent of the actual devices being used.  Cockpit uses Python's
  `Microscope package <https://www.python-microscope.org>`__ to
  control the devices.  The graphical interface and experiments
  automatically adjust to the existing devices.

- Very fast device control and time precision.  During experiments,
  devices are controlled via hardware signals.

- Cross Platform.  Cockpit can run on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows.

- Cockpit is free and open source software, released under the GPL.
