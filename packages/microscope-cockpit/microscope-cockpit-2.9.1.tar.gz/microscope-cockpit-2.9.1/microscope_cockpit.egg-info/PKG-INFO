Description: Cockpit is a microscope graphical user interface.  It is a flexible
        and easy to extend platform aimed at life scientists using bespoke
        microscopes.  Its main features are:
        
        - Easy to use and extend by life scientists.  Cockpit is completely
          written in Python and meant to be extended by the user.
        
        - Independent of the actual devices being used.  Cockpit uses Python's
          `Microscope package <https://www.python-microscope.org>`__ to
          control the devices.  The graphical interface and experiments
          automatically adjust to the existing devices.
        
        - Very fast device control and time precision.  During experiments,
          devices are controlled via hardware signals.
        
        - Cross Platform.  Cockpit can run on GNU/Linux, Mac, and Windows.
        
        - Cockpit is free and open source software, released under the GPL.
