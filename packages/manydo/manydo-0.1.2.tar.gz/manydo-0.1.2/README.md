# manydo
Dead-simple parallel execution.

## Installation
`pip install manydo`. Or, better for you, use [Poetry](python-poetry.org/): `poetry add manydo`.

## Usage
`manydo` is simple. All you need is `map`:
```python
from manydo import map

map(lambda x: x + 3, [1, 2, 3]) # [4, 5, 6]
map(function, iterable, num_jobs=16) # try not to burn your CPU
map(function, tqdm(iterable)) # will properly handle tqdm
```
