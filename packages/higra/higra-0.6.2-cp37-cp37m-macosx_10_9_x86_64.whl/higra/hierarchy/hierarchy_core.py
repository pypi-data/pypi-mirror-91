    """
    Computes the *canonical binary partition tree*, also called *binary partition tree by altitude ordering* or
    *connectivity constrained single min/linkage clustering* of the given graph.

    :Definition:

    The following definition is adapted from:

        Cousty, Jean, Laurent Najman, Yukiko Kenmochi, and Silvio Guimar√£es.
        `"Hierarchical segmentations with graphs: quasi-flat zones, minimum spanning trees, and saliency maps."
        <https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01344727/document>`_
        Journal of Mathematical Imaging and Vision 60, no. 4 (2018): 479-502.

    Let :math:`G=(V,E)` be an undirected graph, let :math:`\\prec` be a total order on :math:`E`, and let :math:`e_k` be
    the edge in :math:`E` that has exactly :math:`k` smaller edges according to :math:`\\prec`: we then say that :math:`k`
    is the rank of :math:`e_k` (for :math:`\\prec`).
    The *canonical binary partition hierarchy* of :math:`G` for :math:`\\prec` is defined as the sequence of nested partitions:

    - :math:`P_0 = \{\{v\}, v\in V\}`, the finest partion is composed of every singleton of :math:`V`; and
    - :math:`P_n = (P_{n-1} \\backslash \{P_{n-1}^x, P_{n-1}^y\}) \cup (P_{n-1}^x \cup P_{n-1}^y)` where :math:`e_n=\{x,y\}`
      and :math:`P_{n-1}^x` and :math:`P_{n-1}^y` are the regions of  :math:`P_{n-1}` that contain :math:`x` and :math:`y`
      respectively.

    At the step :math:`n`, we remove the regions at the two extremities of the :math:`n`-th smallest edge
    and we add their union. Note that we may have :math:`P_n = P_{n-1}` if both extremities of the edge :math:`e_n`
    were in a same region of :math:`P_{n-1}`. Otherwise, :math:`P_n` is obtained by merging two regions of :math:`P_{n-1}`.

    The *canonical binary partition tree* is then the tree representing the merging steps in this sequence,
    it is thus binary. Each merging step, and thus each non leaf node of the tree, is furthermore associated to a
    specific edge of the graph, called *a building edge* that led to this merge. It can be shown that the set of all
    building edges associated to a canonical binary partition tree is a minimum spanning tree of the graph for the given
    edge ordering :math:`\\prec`.

    The map that associates every non leaf node of the canonical binary partition tree to its building edge is called
    the *mst_edge_map*. In practice this map is represented by an array of size :math:`tree.num\_vertices() - tree.num\_leaves()`
    and, for any internal node :math:`i` of the tree, :math:`mst\_edge\_map[i - tree.num\_leaves()]` is equal to the index
    of the building edge in :math:`G` associated to :math:`i`.

    The ordering :math:`\\prec` can be specified explicitly by providing the array of indices :attr:`sorted_edge_indices`
    that sort the edges, or implicitly by providing the array of edge weights :attr:`edge_weights`. In this case,
    :attr:`sorted_edge_indices` is set equal to ``hg.arg_sort(edge_weights, stable=True)``. If :attr:`edge_weights`
    is an array with more than 1 dimension, a lexicographic ordering is used.

    If requested, altitudes associated to the nodes of the canonical binary partition tree are computed as follows:

      - if :attr:`edge_weights` are provided, the altitude of a non-leaf node is equal to the edge weight of its
        building edge; and
      - otherwise, the altitude of a non-leaf node is equal to the rank of its building edge.

    The altitude of a leaf node is always equal to 0.

    :Example:

    .. figure:: /fig/canonical_binary_partition_tree_example.svg
        :alt: Example of a binary partition tree by altitude ordering
        :align: center

        Given an edge weighted graph :math:`G`, the binary partition tree by altitude ordering :math:`T` (in blue) is
        associated to a minimum spanning tree :math:`S` of :math:`G` (whose edges are thick and gray). Each leaf node of
        the tree corresponds to a vertex of :math:`G` while each non-leaf node :math:`n_i` of :math:`T` corresponds to a
        building edge of :math:`T` which belongs to the minimum spanning tree :math:`S`. The association between the non-leaf
        nodes and the minimum spanning tree edges, called *mst_edge_map*, is depicted by green arrows .


    The above figure corresponds to the following code (note that vertex indices start at 0 in the code):

        >>> g = hg.UndirectedGraph(5)
        >>> g.add_edges((0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3),
        >>>             (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4))
        >>> edge_weights = np.asarray((4, 6, 3, 7, 11, 8, 5))
        >>> tree, altitudes = hg.bpt_canonical(g, edge_weights)
        >>> tree.parents()
        array([6, 5, 5, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8])
        >>> altitudes
        array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 7])
        >>> tree.mst_edge_map
        array([2, 0, 6, 3])
        >>> tree.mst.edge_list()
        (array([1, 0, 3, 1]), array([2, 1, 4, 3]))

    An object of type UnidrectedGraph is not necessary:

        >>> edge_weights = np.asarray((4, 6, 3, 7, 11, 8, 5))
        >>> sources = (0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3)
        >>> targets = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4)
        >>> tree, altitudes = hg.bpt_canonical((sources, targets, 5), edge_weights)
        >>> tree.parents()
        array([6, 5, 5, 7, 7, 6, 8, 8, 8])
        >>> altitudes
        array([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 3, 4, 5, 7])
        >>> tree.mst_edge_map
        array([2, 0, 6, 3])

    with :math:`n` the number of elements in the graph and with :math`\\alpha` the inverse of the Ackermann function.
    Otherwise, the computation time is dominated by the sorting of the edge weights which is performed in linearithmic
    :math:`\mathcal{O}(n \log(n))` time.
