Changes in nbformat
=========================

In Development
==============

5.1.0
=====

- Implemented CellIds from JEP-62
- Fixed a regression introduced when using fastjsonschema,
  which does not directly support to validate a "reference"/"subschema"
- Removed unreachable/unneeded code
- Added CI workflow for package release on tag push

5.0.8
=====

- Add optional support for using `fastjsonschema` as the JSON validation library.
  To enable fast validation, install `fastjsonschema` and set the environment
  variable `NBFORMAT_VALIDATOR` to the value `fastjsonschema`.

5.0.7
=====

- Fixed a bug where default values for validator.get_validator() failed with an import error

5.0.6
=====

- nbformat.read() function has a better duck-type interface and will raise more
  meaningful error messages if it can't parse a notebook document.

5.0.5
=====

- Allow notebook format 4.0 and 4.1 to have the arbitrary JSON mimebundles
  from format 4.2 for pragmatic purposes.
- Support reading/writing path-like objects has been added to read operations.

5.0.4
=====

- Fixed issue causing python 2 to pick up 5.0.x releases.

5.0.3
=====

- Removed debug print statements from project.

5.0.2
=====

- Added schema validation files for older versions. This was breaking notebook generation.

5.0.1
=====

`5.0 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestone/5>`__

- Starting with 5.0, ``nbformat`` is now Python 3 only (>= 3.5)
- Add execution timings in code cell metadata for v4 spec.
  ``"metadata": { "execution": {...}}`` should be populated with kernel-specific
  timing information.
- Documentation for how markup is used in notebooks added
- Link to json schema docs from format page added
- Documented the editable metadata flag
- Update description for collapsed field
- Documented notebook format versions 4.0-4.3 with accurate json schema specification files

- Added a default execution_count of None for new_output_cell('execute_result')
- Added support for handling nbjson kwargs
- Wheels now correctly have a LICENSE file
- Travis builds now have a few more execution environments

4.4
===

`4.4 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestone/9>`__

- Explicitly state that metadata fields can be ignored.
- Introduce official jupyter namespace inside metadata (``metadata.jupyter``).
- Introduce ``source_hidden`` and ``outputs_hidden`` as official front-end
  metadata fields to indicate hiding source and outputs areas. **NB**: These
  fields should not be used to hide elements in exported formats.
- Fix ending the redundant storage of signatures in the signature database.
- :func:`nbformat.validate` can be set to not raise a ValidationError if
  additional properties are included.
- Fix for errors with connecting and backing up the signature database.
- Dict-like objects added to NotebookNode attributes are now transformed to be
  NotebookNode objects; transformation also works for `.update()`.


4.3
===

`4.3 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestone/7>`__

- A new pluggable ``SignatureStore`` class allows specifying different ways to
  record the signatures of trusted notebooks. The default is still an SQLite
  database. See :ref:`pluggable_signature_store` for more information.
- :func:`nbformat.read` and :func:`nbformat.write` accept file paths as bytes
  as well as unicode.
- Fix for calling :func:`nbformat.validate` on an empty dictionary.
- Fix for running the tests where the locale makes ASCII the default encoding.
- Include nbformat-schema files (v3 and v4) in nbformat-schema npm package.
- Include configuration for appveyor's continuous integration service.

4.2

4.2.0
-----

`4.2 on GitHub <https://github.com/jupyter/nbformat/milestones/4.2>`__

- Update nbformat spec version to 4.2, allowing JSON outputs to have any JSONable type,  not just ``object``,
  and mime-types of the form ``application/anything+json``.
- Define basics of ``authors`` in notebook metadata.
  ``nb.metadata.authors`` shall be a list of objects with the property ``name``, a string of each author's full name.
- Update use of traitlets API to require traitlets 4.1.
- Support trusting notebooks on stdin with ``cat notebook | jupyter trust``
