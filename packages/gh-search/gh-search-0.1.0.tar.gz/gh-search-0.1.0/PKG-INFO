        ## Developing
        
        When making changes to the module it is always a good idea to run everything within a Python virtual environment to ensure isolation of dependencies.
        
        ```bash
        # Python3
        pyvenv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        make install-dev
        ```
        
        Unit tests are written using pytest and can be run from the root of the project with
        
        ```bash
        make unit
        ```
        
        ```bash
        make lint
        ```
