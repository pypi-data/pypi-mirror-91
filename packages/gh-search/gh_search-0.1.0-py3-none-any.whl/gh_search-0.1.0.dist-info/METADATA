-->

## Developing

When making changes to the module it is always a good idea to run everything within a Python virtual environment to ensure isolation of dependencies.

```bash
# Python3
pyvenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
make install-dev
```

Unit tests are written using pytest and can be run from the root of the project with

```bash
make unit
```

```bash
make lint
```
