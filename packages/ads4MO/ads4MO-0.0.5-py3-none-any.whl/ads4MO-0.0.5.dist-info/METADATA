# ads4MO - Added Download Services 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/carmelosammarco/ads4mo.png)](https://travis-ci.com/carmelosammarco/ads4mo) [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/y4glc7d7ccjb8diq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/carmelosammarco/ads4mo) [![PyPi](https://img.shields.io/badge/PyPi-Project-yellow.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ads4MO/) [![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ads4mo/community.svg)](https://gitter.im/ads4mo/community?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge) 

**I developed this software because motivated to improve my efficiency and productivity. It is just an attemp/idea/prototype and it is not fully optimased or considered stable.**

**This project gave me also ideas to develop other tools** as [tool4NC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/tool4NC), [JupLab4NetCDF](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/JupLab4NetCDF) and [MerOC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/MerOC). To know more about them just visit the projects web pages which are hyperlinked above.

I created also a **chat-community** powered by "Gitter" where is possible have an exchange of ideas,functionalities,bugs and many more. Just click ![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/ads4mo/community.svg) to acces the chat room.

Many thanks to visit this page and try this python software.

## Introduction:
It is possible download data by MONTH, DEPTH or DAY until a maximum of three selected variables(Planning to increase this number thought).
It brings in a very intuitive scripting way what was already proposed with [MerOC](https://github.com/carmelosammarco/MerOC).

## Be aware that:

The tool is in development so it can be possible find bugs, errors and imprecisions. Please to report them if you find one.

## Dependencies:

The dependencies required which are not installed by default are listed below:

- [x] motuclient>=1.8.1
- [x] ftputil>=3.4

## Installation and module usage

It is possible to install and then use in both UNIX and Windows operative systems following the below steps:

```
pip install ads4MO
```
we can import the module as:

```
from ads4MO import download
```
Once the module is imported we can call the interactive download process typing;

```
download()
```

At this point the system is going to ask:

- **Username and password**

- **Type of the download** which can be set typing one of the following:

     - **MONTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by months
     - **DEPTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by depth levels
     - **DAY**: The entire period selected will download as daily files
     - **MONTH&DEPTH**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by months and depth levels
     - **YEAR**: The entire period selected will be downloaded by years. Very usefull just when you want extract a grid point (The --longitude-min = --longitude-min and --latitude-min = --latitude-max).

- **Starting/Ending Time**: If not values as HH:MM:SS are typed then "12:00:00" is going to be used as default value.

- **Motu client script** which is generated by the CMEMS web portal.
Please to copy and paste just from the "--motu" until the end. You can leave untouched   "--out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME.> --pwd <PASSWORD.>" because they were already set previously.

Following an example of the full script generted by the Web-portal:

```
python -m motuclient  --motu http://..... --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --date-max "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT  --out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD>
```

What you need to use as module's input:

```
--motu http://nrt.cmems-du.eu/motu-web/Motu --service-id GLOBAL_ANALYSIS_FORECAST_PHY_001_024-TDS --product-id global-analysis-forecast-phy-001-024 --longitude-min -180 --longitude-max 179.9166717529297 --latitude-min -80 --latitude-max 90 --date-min "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --date-max "2019-04-19 12:00:00" --depth-min 0.493 --depth-max 0.4942 --variable thetao --variable bottomT  --out-dir <OUTPUT_DIR> --out-name <OUTPUT_FILENAME> --user <USERNAME> --pwd <PASSWORD>
```

The results are going to be downloaded in the file path in which the terminal/command-prompt was at the moment of the data request.

## Stand-alone applications (No Python installation required):

---------

**The stand-alone App for Windows OS can be downloaded from [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/e5ilv9x84m4m0gk/ads4mo-win.exe?dl=0).**

The APP was developed, compiled and tested in Windows 10 environment. As soon as I have time I will try to test it in other Windows environments. It will generate a folder  in which all the data downloaded are going to be stored. This folder will be stored in the same system path where the executable "ads4mo-win.exe" is located.

---------

**The stand-alone App for macOS can be downloaded from [HERE](https://www.dropbox.com/s/vimrdqhcri5tevm/ads4mo-macOS.zip?dl=0).**

If the APP doesn't start because of "unidentified developer" message then you need to give the system the permission to run it. In more details, please to go in **Security & Privacy** (Tab "General") and then click on the button which will allows the execution of the tool. It will create a Desktop folder  which will store all the data downloaded.
