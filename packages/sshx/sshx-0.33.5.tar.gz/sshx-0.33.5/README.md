```

## Quick Start

1. Initialization.

    Perform only once after you've installed sshx.

    ```bash
    sshx init
    ```

2. Adding an account.

    ```bash
    sshx add myhost -l test@192.168.9.155
    ```

    (This command will ask you to type your password and sshx would store the encrypted password.)

3. Connect to the account.

    ```bash
    sshx connect myhost
    ```
