Thresholds
##########

Thresholds are the simplest type of filter in ``latools``. They identify regions where the concentration or local gradient of an analyte is above or below a threshold value.

Appropriate thresholds may be determined from prior knowledge of the samples, or by examining whole-analysis level cross-plots of the concentration or local gradients of all pairs of analytes, which reveal relationships within all the ablations, allowing distinct contaminant compositions to be identified and removed.

.. tip :: All the following examples will work on the example dataset worked through in the :ref:`beginners_guide`. If you try multiple examples, be sure to run ``eg.filter_clear()`` in between each example, or the filters might not behave as expected.

Concentration Filter
====================

Selects data where a target analyte is above or below a specified threshold.

For example, applying an threshold Al/Ca value of 100 Î¼mol/mol to ``Sample-1`` of the example data:

.. code-block :: python

    # Create the filter.
    eg.filter_threshold(analyte='Al27', threshold=100e-6)

This creates two filters - one that selects data above the threshold, and one that selects data below the threshold. To see what filters you've created, and whether they're 'on' or 'off', use :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.filter_status`, which will print::

    Subset All_Samples:

    n  Filter Name          Mg24   Mg25   Al27   Ca43   Ca44   Mn55   Sr88   Ba137  Ba138  
    0  Al27_thresh_below    False  False  False  False  False  False  False  False  False  
    1  Al27_thresh_above    False  False  False  False  False  False  False  False  False

To effect the data, a filter must be activated:

.. code-block :: python

    # Select data below the threshold
    eg.filter_on('Al27_below')

    # Plot the data for Sample-1 only
    eg.data['Sample-1'].tplot(filt=True)

.. image :: ./figs/1-conc-absolute.png

Data above the threshold values (dashed line) are excluded by this filter (greyed out).

.. tip :: When using :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.filter_on` or :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.filter_off`, you don't need to specify the *entire* filter name displayed by :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.filter_status`. These functions identify the filter with the name most similar to the text you entered, and activate/deactivate it.

Gradient Filter
===============

Selects data where a target analyte is not changing - i.e. its gradient is constant. This filter starts by calculating the local gradient of the target analyte:

.. figure :: ./figs/1-gradient-calc.gif
    :align: center

    Calculating a moving gradient for the Al27 analyte. When calculating the gradient the ``win`` parameter specifies how many points are used when calculating the local gradient.

For example, imagine a calcium carbonate sample which we know should have constant Al concentration. In this sample, variable Al is indicative of a contaminant phase. A gradient threshold filter can be used to isolate regions where Al is constant, and more likeley to be contaminant-free. To create an apply this filter:

.. code-block :: python
    
    eg.filter_gradient_threshold(analyte='Al27', threshold=0.5e-5, win=25)
    
    eg.filter_on('Al27_g_below')

    # plot the gradient for Sample-1
    eg.data['Sample-1'].gplot('Al27', win=25)
    # plot the effect of the filter for Sample-1
    eg.data['Sample-1'].tplot(filt=True)

.. image :: ./figs/1-grad-absolute.png

The top panel shows the calculated gradient, with the regions above and below the threshold value greyed out.
the bottom panel shows the data regions selected by the filter for all elements.

Choosing a gradient ``threshold`` value
---------------------------------------

Gradients are in units of **mol[X] / mol[internal standard] / s**. The absolute value of the gradient will change depending on the value of ``win`` used.

Working out what a gradient ``threshold`` value should be from first principles can be a little complex.
The best way to choose a threshold value is by looking at the data.
There are three functions to help you do this:

* :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.gradient_plots` Calculates the local gradient of all samples, plots the gradients, and saves them as a pdf. The gradient equivalent of :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.trace_plots`.
* :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.gradient_histogram` Plot histograms of the local gradients in the entire dataset.
* :meth:`~latools.latools.analyse.gradient_crossplot` Create crossplots of the local gradients for all analyes.

.. tip :: The value of ``win`` used when calculating the gradient will effect the absolute value of the calculated gradient. Make sure you use the same ``win`` value creating filters and viewing gradients.

#####################
Percentile Thresholds
#####################

In cases where the absolute threshold value is not known, a percentile may be used. An absolute threshold value is then calculated from the raw data at either the individual-ablation or population level, and used to create a threshold filter.

.. warning :: In general, we discourage the use of percentile filters. It is always better to examine and understand the patterns in your data, and choose absolute thresholds. However, we have come across cases where they have proved useful, so they remain an available option.

Concentration Filter: Percentile
================================

For example, to remove regions containing the top 10% of Al concentrations:

.. code-block :: python

    eg.filter_threshold_percentile(analyte='Al27', percentiles=90)

    eg.filter_on('Al_below')

    eg.data['Sample-1'].tplot(filt=True)

.. image :: ./figs/1-conc-percentile.png

The histogram on the right shows the distribution of Al data in the sample, with a line showing the 90th percentile of the data, corresponding to the threshold value used.

Gradient Filter: Percentile
===========================

The principle of this filter is the same, but it operatures on the local gradient of the data, instead of the absolute concentrations.
