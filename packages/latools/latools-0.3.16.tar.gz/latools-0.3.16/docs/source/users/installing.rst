====================
Prerequisite: Python
====================

Before you install ``latools``, you'll need to make sure you have a working installation of Python, **preferably Python 3**. 
If you don't already have this (or are unsure if you do), we recommend that you install one of the pre-packaged science-oriented Python distributions, like Continuum's `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution>`_.
This provides a working copy of Python, and most of the modules that ``latools`` relies on.

If you already have a working Python installation or don't want to install one of the pre-packaged Python distributions, everything below `should` work.

.. tip:: Make sure you set the Anaconda Python installation as the system default, or you are working in a virtual environment that uses the correct Python version. If you don't know what a virtual environment' is, don't worry - just make sure you check the box saying 'make this my default Python' at the appropriate time when installing Anaconda.

======================
Installing ``latools``
======================

There are two ways to install ``latools``. We recommend the first method, which will allow you to easily keep your installation of ``latools`` up to date with new developments.

Both methods require entering commands in a terminal window. On Mac, open the **Terminal** application in '/Applications/Utilities'. On Windows, this is a little more complex - `see instructions here <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/using-pip-on-windows>`_.

----------------
1. Using ``pip``
----------------

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install latools

For in-depth instructions on using `pip`, see `here <https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html>`_

------------------
2. Using ``conda``
------------------
