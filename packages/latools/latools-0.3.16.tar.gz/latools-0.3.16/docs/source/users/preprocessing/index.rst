``latoools`` expects data to be organised in a :ref:`particular way\ <data_formats>`. If your data do not meet these expectations, you'll have to do some pre-processing to get your data into a format that latools can deal with. These pages contain information on the 'preprocessing' tools you can use to prepare your data for ``latools``.

If the methods described here don't work for you, or your data is in a format that can't be handled by them, please `let us know <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/latools>`_ and we'll work out how to accommodate your data.
