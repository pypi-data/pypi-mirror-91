Miccoc
---
The Python client library for Micoo. This library provide below functions:

- new_build
- build_stats
- latest_build_stats

## newBuild
Upload screenshots to and trigger visual test build in Micoo.

### usage example:
```python
from micooc import new_build


def test_new_build():
    service_host = "http://localhost:8123"
    engine_host = service_host + "/engine"
    pid = "PIDa8e3c0a4444a4f1a90a4dad8bd3467c2"

    build_version = "5fafc0478af24af2da45fa19ddd06c17dd5d0d45"
    screenshot_directory = "./screenshots"

    new_build(engine_host, pid, build_version, screenshot_directory)

test_new_build();
```
### parameters
* `host` - the Micoo's base URL plus `/engine`,
* `pid` - your Micoo project's PID, it can be found from the Micoo project page's URL,
* `build_version` - this build version is neither parts of Micoo, nor your UI automation test, it needs to be the version of you SUT application, most of the case, it's the git revision number. `buildVersion` is a useful setup of mappings between your visual tests and the SUT application. Anyway, technically, it's just a string which will be displayed in Micoo's project board, you can use anything which is meaningful to you.
* `screenshot_directory` - the directory where contains all screenshots to be uploaded, only `.png` file will be uploaded. All the uploaded screenshot filename becomes the test case name, so there are some restriction to the filename, it must shorter than 100 letters and match [a-zA-Z0-9-_&()#].

### About `build_version`
`build_version` comes from the SUT application Version Control System, e.g. GIT, SVN, and they are probably differentiate from different test builds, especially when integrate the visual test in CI, so, a more valid usage is to pass its value from environment variable

## build_stats
Get the stats of a specific build

### usage example

```python
from micooc import build_stats


def test_build_stats():
    service_host = "http://localhost:8123"
    bid = "BIDfb1c90b110124e10a280d5ac5fc9cd20"

    build_stats(service_host, bid)

test_build_stats()
```

### parameters

* `host` - the Micoo's base URL,
* `bid` - the Micoo build's bid, once you use `newBuild` to create a new build, its `bid` will be returned in the response.


## latestBuildStats
Get the stats of a project's latest build

### usage example

```javascript
const { latestBuildStats } = require("micooc");

async function testLatestBuildStats() {
  const host = "http://localhost:8123";
  const pid = "PID6fb00c63d17f4596ba831a299edd21b4";

  console.log(await latestBuildStats(host, pid));
}

testLatestBuildStats();
```
### parameters

* `host` - the Micoo's base URL,
* `pid` - the Micoo project's PID, it can be found from the Micoo project page's URL,
