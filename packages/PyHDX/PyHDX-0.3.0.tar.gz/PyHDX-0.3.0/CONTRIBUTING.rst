Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/Jhsmit/pyhdx/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

Pull Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can contribute code by submitting a pull request. If you contribute new features describe in your
PR what the new feature does, possible references to literature and how it should be used.

The PR should add new tests for the new feature and all current tests should pass. New functions and
classes should have docstrings and ideally code examples and documentation should be added.
