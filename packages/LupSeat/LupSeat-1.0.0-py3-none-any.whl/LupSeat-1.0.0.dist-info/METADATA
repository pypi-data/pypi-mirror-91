## Instructions
Run with 
`python3 main.py students_file seats_file [--partner partner_file] [--out output_file] [--fmt output_format] [--gout output_gfile] [--seed seed_num] [--algorithm algorithm_type] [--eval] [--nosave]`

-students\_file - A csv file containing first name, middle name, last name, student id, dominant hand, special needs flag (see students.csv for example)

-seats\_file - A yaml file containing the room seating information. (see seats.txt for example)

-output\_file - Name of output file

-output\_format - Output format string

-output\_gfile - Name of output image file

-seed\_num - A seed for the randomizer to produce deterministic results.

-algorithm\_type - Specifies the algorithm (can be chunkincrease or consecdivide)

-eval - A flag to produce evaluation score (average number of students sitting next to each other). Lower score is better.

-nosave - A flag to disable saving output files (used primarily for automated evaluation).

## Output format string
The output format string specifies how students are identified in the output file.

Variable names: sid, fname, lname.

### Examples
`{fname} {lname} has sid {sid}`

`{sid|-5,-1}`

`{fname|0}.{lname|0}.`
