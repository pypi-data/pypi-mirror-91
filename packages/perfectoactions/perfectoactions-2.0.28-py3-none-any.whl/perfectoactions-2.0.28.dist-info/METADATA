# PerfectoActions
[![Downloads](https://pepy.tech/badge/perfectoactions)](https://pepy.tech/project/perfectoactions)

Official documentation: https://developers.perfectomobile.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=50922763



With PerfectoActions, you can create maintenance scripts that handle the cleanup, reboot, and retrieval of network settings in parallel and across all or specific devices in the Perfecto lab. In addition, you can set up scheduling for these scripts to run at the desired interval, depending on the devices involved. You can also view or delete old media repository items and list all/ specific users automatically. Device manufacturers which doesnt support auto-connect on reboot are skipped automatically.

This non-flash, non-native, multi-threaded solution replaces the following Perfecto native automation commands: clean device, reboot device, and get network settings. For more details and samples, see this GitHub project: https://github.com/PerfectoMobileSA/Device_actions_reporter
The results appear in a fully responsive, dark mode themed, accessible HTML report with direct access to available devices and the option to:

        * Search for devices and users in the displayed HTML tables
        * View direct API results for clean and restart commands
        * Raise a Perfecto support ticket
        * Open your Perfecto cloud
        * Navigate to Perfecto documentation
        * Get information on device status, manufacturer, model, OS version, description, SIM operator graphs and users.
        * View a complete device status and user list summary
        * View accurate, expandable graphs, also available in full-screen view
        * Download a full Get Devices List API response/  Users List based on criteria to an excel file.

## Recommended system configuration:

    1. 8 GB Ram and above

    2. 2.20 GHz multi core processors and above

                            Perfecto get user list API parameters to limit user list. Support all API capabilities which selects users based on applicable parameters, Leave it empty to select all users
    -t [Different types of Device Connection status], --device_status [Different types of Device Connection status]
                            Different types of Device Connection status. Values: all. This will showcase all the device status like Available, Disconnected, un-available & Busy. Note: Only Available devices will be shown by default
    -a [actions], --actions [actions]
                            Perfecto actions seperated by semi-colon. E.g. reboot:true;cleanup:true;get_network_settings:true
    -r [refresh], --refresh [refresh]
                            Refreshes the page with latest device status as per provided interval in seconds
    -o [output in html], --output [output in html]
                            output in html. Values: true/false. Default is true
    -l [shows customer logo], --logo [shows customer logo]
                            shows client logo if valid official client website url is specified in this sample format: www.perfecto.io


## Examples:

### Device Operations:

1. List all available devices:  <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>"`


2. List all available devices with an optional feature to provide custom logo ( Syntax: -l "www.<official customer website>): <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -l "www.perfecto.io"`

3. List all available devices using perfecto username and password: <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<username/email>>:<<password>>"`


4. List all devices irrespective on device status: <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -t all`


5. Reboot, clean up and get network settings for all devices in parallel: <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -t "all" -a "reboot:true;cleanup:true;get_network_settings:true"`


6. Limit the selection of devices by applying any/multiple Get Devices List parameters and regular expressions using the following syntax: {param1}:{value1};{param2}:{value2}

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -d "model:Galaxy S.*;description:.*Genesis;dynamicField.ipa:Test-Android.*"`

7. get network settings like airplane mode, wifi and data for only available galaxy devices in parallel: <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>"  -a "get_network_settings:true" -d "model:Galaxy.*"`


### Repository clean-up:

1. Syntax to automatically display older repository items: -a "clean_repo|false|{do you have admin role? - true|false }|media repository locations|number of days to select items older than the provided date". The following example will automatically display repository media items older than 15 days

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -a "clean_repo|false|true|PUBLIC:Genesis/Temp/,PRIVATE:Python,GROUP:Genesis|15"`

2. Syntax to automatically delete older repository items: -a "clean_repo|true|{do you have admin role? - true|false} |media repository locations|number of days to select items older than the provided date". The following example will automatically delete and display repository media items older than 15 days

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -a "clean_repo|true|true|PUBLIC:Genesis/Temp/,PRIVATE:Python,GROUP:Genesis|15"`


### Limit User list:

1. Syntax to limit/filter users list: -u "{param1}:{value1};{param2}:{value2}"

     `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -u "roles:AUTOMATION;firstName:Genesis"`

### General:

1. Re-runs the same execution with a specified sleep time: <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -r 1`


2. Skip's output in html format: ( for faster results in terminal/cmd ) <br />

    `perfectoactions -c "<<CLOUD NAME>>" -s "<<SECURITY TOKEN>>" -o false`

Notes: </br>
    Reach out to Perfecto support if you want to enable non-admin users the ability to delete media repository files for users who have access to the same group folder.
	We recommend that you assign a unique description or dynamicField for devices that are applicable for reboot and utilize the -d parameter for reboot. See the Limit the selection of the devices example.</br>
	PerfectoActions is subject to the same restrictions and limitations as the Reboot device API, with regard to locked phones and limitations to reboot devices by certain manufacturers. For details, see [Devices Restart Limitation](https://developers.perfectomobile.com/display/TT/Devices+Restart+Limitation). However, the latest perfecto actions version will automatically skips manufacturers which are listed as limitations for reboot. </br>

### Note:

    1. Make sure active scripting is enabled in IE browser.
    2. Preferred browsers are Chrome and Safari.
    3. Kindly use python version 3 and above.

## Experimental proxy: ( Yet to be tested )

    Configure proxies by setting environment variables HTTP_PROXY and HTTPS_PROXY. E.g. in mac:

        export HTTP_PROXY="10.10.1.10:3128"
        export HTTPS_PROXY="10.10.1.10:1080"

    To use HTTPS Basic Auth with your proxy, try this: https://user:password@host:port

        export HTTP_PROXY="https://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/"
        export HTTPS_PROXY="https://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/"

    Note: avoid using special characters such as :,@ in username and passwords

## Scheduling in Windows:
