Description: Qt Elements qte
        ===============
        
        A number of templates and tools to develop Qt GUI's with Python effectively.
        
        Developing GUIs I often find myself creating forms to pass some input and also
        running some task asynchronously so that the interface is still responsive.
        
        This little package tries to address both recurring requirements.
