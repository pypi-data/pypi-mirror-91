Infrastructure Launcher
=======================

The launcher of the Dead-Hosts infrastructure and project.

Installation
------------

::

    $ pip3 install --user dead-hosts-launcher

Configuration
-------------

To work, the launcher will look for a file named :code:`info.json` in
your current directory.

The file should look like follow:

::

    {
        "currently_under_test": false, # Don't touch this.
        "custom_pyfunceble_config": {}, # Put your PyFunceble custom configuration here.
        "days_until_next_test": 0.0,  # Ask an admin. Otherwise, this is the number of days between each authorizations.
        "name": "[repository-name]",  # The name of the current repository. WARNING: Paritially autocompleted under CI.
        "own_management": false,  # You are the one managing the PyFunceble configuration.
        "ping": [],  # Put your GitHub username here to get a mention at the end of the test of your file.
        "raw_link": "[URL]" # Put the link to your file. Or leave empty and fill the origin.list file.
    }

Persistent configuration
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The launcher has some hard-coded configuration that can't be changed. Even
if you try to overwrite them, the configuration will just overwite them.

Please consider the following as a flatten representation of the PyFunceble
configuration. Meaning that each :code:`.` is a nested dictionary.

::

    {
        "cli_testing.cooldown_time": 1.25,
        "cli_testing.display_mode.execution_time": True,
        "cli_testing.ci.max_exec_minutes": 20,
        "cli_testing.max_workers": 1,
    }
