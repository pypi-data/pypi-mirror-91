Gaia photometry tools.

This package provides classes and functions for transforming between the Gaia photometric system and
other photometric systems. The formulae and tables are taken from the Gaia science performance pages:
  http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=GAIA&page=Science_Performance
and also from the paper by Jordi et al (http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010A%26A...523A..48J).
