    'long_description': "# AWSLOGIN\nPython script for CLI and SDK access to AWS via ADFS while requiring MFA\naccess using <https://duo.com/>\n\n# History and Purpose\n\nBYU used to use the great [aws-adfs](https://github.com/venth/aws-adfs)\nCLI tool to login to our AWS accounts. It worked great, especially the\nDUO 2FA support. Eventually, we decided to write our own similar tool\nbut make it BYU-specific so that we could tailor it to our needs (which\nbasically means hard-code certain BYU-specific things) and remove some\nof the required parameters. Since this tool will be used by BYU\nemployees only we had that option. We then morphed it a little more for\nour use cases. This isn't something that you could use outside of BYU,\nsorry.\n\n# DUO 2FA Requirements\nIn order for Duo 2FA to work properly Automatic Push needs to be enabled.\n\n# Installation\n\n  - Python 3.6+ is recommended as python2 is EOL January 2020.\n  - It is highly recommended to use an application like [Pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/) to install and use python cli applications.\n  - Follow the pipx [installation documentation](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/installation/) then simply run `pipx install byu_awslogin`\n  - Experimental Binaries are available on the releases page. These are new and in testing [Releases](https://gihtub.com/byu-oit/awslogin/releases)\n  - See the [installation options](https://github.com/byu-oit/awslogin/blob/master/INSTALLATION_OPTIONS.md) For additional options\n    page for step by step instructions for installing in various environments\n\n# Upgrading\n\nIf you already have byu\\_awslogin install and are looking to upgrade\nsimply run\n\n`pip3 install --upgrade byu_awslogin` or `pip install --upgrade\nbyu_awslogin` as appropriate for your python installation\n\n# Usage\n\nawslogin defaults to the default profile in your \\~/.aws/config and\n\\~/.aws/credentials files. **\\*If you already have a default profile you\nwant to save in your \\~/.aws files make sure to do that before running\nawslogin.**\\*\n\nOnce you're logged in, you can execute commands using the AWS CLI or AWS\nSDK. Try running `aws s3 ls`.\n\nCurrently, AWS temporary credentials are only valid for 1 hour. We cache\nyour ADFS session, however, so you can just re-run `awslogin` again to\nget a new set of AWS credentials without logging in again to ADFS. Your\nADFS login session is valid for 8 hours, after which time you'll be\nrequired to login to ADFS again to obtain a new session.\n\nTo switch accounts after you've already authenticated to an account,\njust run awslogin again and select a new account/role combination.\n\nTo use it:\n\n  - Run `awslogin` and it will prompt you for the AWS account and role\n    to use.\n  - Run `awslogin --account <account name> --role <role name>` to skip\n    the prompting for account and name. You could specify just one of\n    the arguments as well.\n  - Run `awslogin --profile <profile name>` to specifiy an alternative\n    profile\n  - Run `awslogin --region <region name>` to specify a different region.\n    The default region is *us-west-2*.\n  - Run `awslogin --status` for the current status of the default\n    profile\n  - Run `awslogin --status --profile dev` for the current status of the\n    dev profile\n  - Run `awslogin --status --profile all` for the current status of the\n    all profiles\n  - Run `awslogin --logout` to logout of a cached ADFS session\n  - Run `awslogin --version` to display the running version of awslogin\n  - Run `awslogin --help` for full help message\n\n# Bash or ZSH Completion\nBash:\n- Run the following: `_AWSLOGIN_COMPLETE=source awslogin > ~/_awslogin` Then add `source /path/to/_awslogin` to .bashrc\n\nZSH:\n- Run the following: `_AWSLOGIN_COMPLETE=source_zsh awslogin > ~/_awslogin` Then add `source /path/to/_awslogin` to .zshrc\n\nAlternatively put the `_awslogin` in your `/etc/bash_completion.d` or similiar directory (`~/.zfunc`) to load at shells startup\n\nTo test if it works run awslogin at least once for the account and role cache to populate. On next login `awslogin -a [TAB][TAB]` should output available accounts and `awslogin -a {some account} -r [TAB][TAB]` should output available roles for the selected account\n\nLimitation: Accounts and Role completion at the CLI is loaded from a cache file. This file will be updated anytime awslogin is ran.\n\n# Reporting bugs or requesting features\n\n  - Enter an issue on the github repo.\n  - Or, even better if you can, fix the issue and make a pull request.\n\n# Deploying changes\n\n  - Update the version in `pyproject.toml` and `__version__.py`\n  - Commit the changes and push.\n  - Build binaries\n  - Create a new release (add binaries and sha256sums.txt) with the version number and Github Actions will build, test and publish\n\n# TODO\n\n  - Write tests\n    - Write more tests to increase overall coverage\n",
