## About The Project

A library written in Rust to check against Wikipedia word frequency corpus. The library is very fast, memory efficient, and safe.
Full lookups are done using a Hashmap data structure. Partial frequency searches are based on a Suffix Array data structure [suffix](https://github.com/BurntSushi/suffix) to perform quick sub-patterns lookups over the dictionary.


### Built With

* [pyo3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
* [suffix](https://github.com/BurntSushi/suffix)


### Installation

```sh
pip3 install pywordfreq
```


## Usage

```python
import pywordfreq


# On the first use of library, the engine is loaded with the dictionary.
# It is worth to mention that there is a significant ammount
# of memory overhead for the engine.

# This function checks the frequency of the word "the" in the corpus
pywordfreq.WordFrequency.full_frequency(
    word="the",
)
# This function checks the frequency of the word "inter" as a pattern
# in other words of the dictionary.
pywordfreq.WordFrequency.partial_frequency(
    pattern="inter",
)
```
