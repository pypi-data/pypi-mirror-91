    Attributes:
        weapon_id: The unique ID of this weapon.
        weapon_group_id: Used to group upgradable weapons together and
            track them as a single entity, such as the Infiltrator's
            Recon Dart Device or the Engineer's Repair Tool.

        unequip_ms: The weapon unequip time in milliseconds.
        to_iron_sights_ms: The ADS enter time in milliseconds.
        from_iron_sights_ms: The ADS exit time in milliseconds.

            identical to :attr:`~auraxium.ps2.FireMode.heat_threshold`,
            but this only uses the first fire mode of the weapon.
        heat_bleed_off_rate: The rate at which the weapon will cool
            down after firing stops.
        heat_overheat_penalty_ms: The overheat penalty imposed if the
            user overheats the weapon.
        melee_detect_width: The hitbox width for melee weapons.
        melee_detect_height: The hitbox height for melee weapons.
