``opty`` utilizes symbolic descriptions of ordinary differential equations
expressed with SymPy_ to form the constraints needed to solve optimal control
and parameter identification problems using the direct collocation method and
non-linear programming. In general, if one can express the continuous first
order ordinary differential equations of the system as symbolic expressions
``opty`` will automatically generate a function to efficiently evaluate the
dynamical constraints and a function that evaluates the sparse Jacobian of the
constraints, which have been optimized for speed and memory consumption. The
translation of the dynamical system description to the NLP form, primarily the
formation of the constraints and the Jacobian of the constraints, manually is
a time consuming and error prone process. ``opty`` eliminates both of those
issues.

Features
--------

- Both implicit and explicit forms of the first order ordinary differential
  equations and differential algebraic equations are supported, i.e. there is
  no need to solve for the derivatives of the dependent variables.
- Backward Euler or Midpoint integration methods.
- Supports both trajectory optimization and parameter identification.
- Easy specification of bounds on free variables.
- Easily specify additional "instance" constraints.
- Automatic parallel execution using openmp if installed.
- Built with support of sympy.physics.mechanics and PyDy in mind.

Installation
============

The required dependencies are as follows:

- python 2.7 or 3.6-3.8
- sympy >= 1.0.0
- ipopt >= 3.11 (Linux & OSX), >= 3.13 (Windows)
- numpy >= 1.8.1
- scipy >= 0.14.1
- cython >= 0.20.1
- cyipopt >= 0.1.7 (Linux & OSX), >= 0.2.0 (Windows)

To run all of the examples the following additional dependencies are required:

- matplotlib >= 1.3.1
- openmp
- pandas
- pydy >= 0.3.0
- pytables
- yeadon

The easiest way to install opty is to first install Anaconda_ (or Miniconda_)
and use the conda package manager to install opty and any desired optional
dependencies from the Conda Forge channel, e.g. opty::

   $ conda install --channel conda-forge opty

and the optional dependencies::

   $ conda install --channel conda-forge matplotlib openmp pandas pydy pytables yeadon

.. _Anaconda: https://www.continuum.io/downloads
.. _Miniconda: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

If you want a custom installation of any of the dependencies, e.g. Ipopt, you
must first install Ipopt along with it's headers.  For example, on Debian based
systems you can use the package manager::

   $ sudo apt-get install coinor-libipopt1v5 coinor-libipopt-dev

or prebuilt binaries can be downloaded from
https://www.coin-or.org/download/binary/Ipopt/.

For customized installation (usually desired for performance) follow the
instructions on the IPOPT documentation to compile the library. If you install
to a location other than ``/usr/local`` on Unix systems you will likely have to
set the ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` so that you can link to IPOPT when installing
``cyipopt``.

Once Ipopt is installed and accessible, install conda then create an environment::

   $ conda create -n opty-custom -c conda-forge cython numpy pip scipy sympy
   $ source activate opty-custom
   (opty-custom)$ pip install ipopt  # this will compile cyipopt against the available ipopt
   (opty-custom)$ pip install opty

If you want to develop opty, create a conda environment with all of the
dependencies installed::

   $ conda config --add channels conda-forge
   $ conda create -n opty-dev python sympy numpy scipy cython ipopt cyipopt matplotlib pytables pydy pandas pytest sphinx numpydoc
   $ source activate opty-dev

Next download the opty source files and install with::

   (opty-dev)$ cd /path/to/opty
   (opty-dev)$ python setup.py develop

Usage
=====

There are several examples available in the ``examples`` directory. For
example, the optimal torque to swing up a pendulum with minimal energy can be
run with::

   $ python examples/pendulum_swing_up.py
