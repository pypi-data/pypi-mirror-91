Description: # CPS relocation
        
        We are Group9 and in the following we'll give you an instruction of how to use our CPS relocation implementation. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary modules.
        
        ```bash
        pip install paramiko
        ```
        
        ```bash
        pip install Owlready2
        ```
        ```bash
        pip install Flask
        ```
        ```bash
        pip install flaskwebgui
        ```
        ```bash
        pip install Werkzeug
        ```
        ```bash
        pip install rdflib
        ```
        For some cases we figured out that a html-library is necessary for running the code. However, this might be optional for you:
        ```bash
        pip install requests
        ```
        
        ## Relocation
        
        By running the "relocation.py" in the folder "relocation" you will get intelligent decisions for a relocation of the CPS1 and CPS2. The decision is based on the ontologies of the CPS.
        
        ### Ontology
        Every decision of the CPS is based on their individual ontology.
        You can find the written .owl files in the folder "Ontologies". For just in time access, the ontologies are positioned on the Apache2 server under following links:
        
        - [CPS1-Ontology](http://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~lukasl93/CPS1.owl)
        - [CPS2-Ontology](http://wwwlab.cs.univie.ac.at/~lukasl93/CPS2.owl)
        
        ### Using Flask
        By running the the "app.py" a link in output console will appear. The URL will probably look like the following: "http://127.0.0.1:1337/". When you open this link your web browser will open and you are confronted with our GUI. The people who will drive with our CPS in the future have the possibility to evaluate the pickup position. The pickup position is the previous decided relocation of the CPS. So try to fill out the survey.

        ## To be continued
        For a even more intelligent CPS decision making, a dynamic influenced ontology is under construction. Stay tuned!!!
