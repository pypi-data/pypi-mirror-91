The :mod:`neurotic.datasets.gdrive` module implements a class for downloading
files from Google Drive using paths, rather than file IDs or shareable links.

class GoogleDriveDownloader(GoogleDrive):
    """
    A class for downloading files from Google Drive using paths.

    Files can be specified for download using URL-like paths of the form

        gdrive://<drive name>/<folder 1>/<...>/<folder N>/<file name>

    The "<drive name>" may be "My Drive" for files located in a personal
    Google Drive, or it may be the name of a Shared Drive that the user has
    permission to access.

    Note that these URL-like paths are not equivalent to ordinary URLs
    associated with Google Drive files, such as shareable links, which are
    composed of pseudorandom file IDs and do not reveal anything about the name
    of the file or the folders containing it.

    This class can only download files that are uniquely identifiable by their
    paths. Google Drive does not require file or folder names to be unique, so
    two or more files or folders with identical names may coexist in a folder.
    Such files and folders cannot be distinguished by their paths, so they
    cannot be downloaded using this class. A download will fail while
    traversing the file tree if at any step there is more than one folder or
    file that matches the path.

    This class manages access authorization, optionally saving authorization
    tokens to a file so that the authorization flow does not need to be
    repeated in the future.

    The ``client_secret_file`` should be the path to a client secret file in
    JSON format, obtained from the `Google API Console
    <https://console.developers.google.com/>`_. The Drive API must be enabled
    for the corresponding client.

    If ``save_tokens=False``, the authorization flow (a request via web browser
    for permission to access Google Drive) will always run the first time a new
    instance of this class is used, and authorization will not persist after
    the instance is destroyed. If ``save_tokens=True`` and a file path is
    provided with ``tokens_file``, access/refresh tokens resulting from a
    successful authorization are stored in the file, and tokens are loaded from
    the file in the future, so that the authorization flow does not need to be
    repeated.

        If ``save_tokens=True``, tokens will be loaded from the ``tokens_file``
        if possible. If tokens cannot be restored this way, or if the loaded
        tokens have expired, an authorization flow will be initiated, prompting
        the user through a web browser to grant read-only privileges to the
        client associated with the ``client_secret_file``. When the
        authorization flow completes, if ``save_tokens=True``, the newly
        created tokens will be stored in the ``tokens_file`` for future use.

        Authorization is performed automatically when needed, but this method
        can be called directly to retrieve (and possibly store) tokens without
        initiating a download.
