# --- neurotic global config --------------------------------------------------
# Use this file to configure the way neurotic behaves. This file uses the TOML
# format.


[defaults]
# When the app is launched, the following customizable defaults are used unless
# overridden by command line arguments. Example uses include:
#   - Uncomment the "file" parameter and insert the path to your favorite
#     metadata file so that it always opens automatically
#   - Uncomment the "lazy" parameter and set it to false to always disable fast
#     loading, ensuring that expensive procedures like spike detection and
#     filtering are performed by default
# To open the example metadata file by default, either leave the "file"
# parameter unset, set it to false, or set it to "example". To initially select
# the first dataset in the file, either leave the "dataset" parameter unset,
# set it to false, or set it to "first".

# file = false
# dataset = false
# debug = false
# lazy = true
# thick_traces = false
# show_datetime = false
# ui_scale = "medium"
# theme = "light"


[gdrive]
# The "save_tokens" parameter controls how often you need to authorize neurotic
# to access your Google Drive account for downloads:
#   - Set "save_tokens" to true to remember Google Drive access tokens after
#     authorization, so that permissions only need to be granted once. This is
#     not recommended if others you do not trust have access to this computer,
#     as it could let them download files from your Google Drive account.
#   - Set "save_tokens" to false or leave it unset to forget access
#     authorization after neurotic closes. Each time you restart neurotic, you
#     will be required to re-grant permissions when you download a Google Drive
#     file.

# save_tokens = false


[app]
# When the app is launched, neurotic automatically checks for updates unless
# the "auto_check_for_updates" parameter is set to false.

# auto_check_for_updates = true
