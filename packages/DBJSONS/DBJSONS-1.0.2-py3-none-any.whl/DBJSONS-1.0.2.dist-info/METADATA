# **dbjson**
## **Get started**
### **things that you need:**
****
* **Python**

  - of course you need it

## **Installation**

## **What is dbjson?**
****
### `dbjson` is [Python](https://www.python.org/) module

Everyone say `JSON` can't be used as database but I don't think `JSON` can't be used as database

With this module you can use `JSON` as database since `JSON` is just [Python](https://www.python.org/) dictionary

## **Example Code**
****
**Creating json file**
```py
import dbjson as db

db.new('database')
```
**Add a data inside our database**
```py
db.data().new('database','data1','value1')
```
### If you open the `JSON` file you can see that `JSON` file will automatically update
```json
//Before
{}
//After
{"data1": "value1"}
```
**How about we want to edit the data?**
### Well,you can use `rewrite` method
```py
db.data().rewrite('database','data1','value2')
```
### check the `JSON` file
```json
//Before
{"data1": "value1"}
//After
{"data1": "value2"}
```
### To remove data we use `remove` method
```py
db.data().remove('database','data1')
```
```json
//Before
{"data1": "value2"}
//After
{}
```
### To remove all the data in our database,we use `end` method
```py
db.data().end('database')
```
