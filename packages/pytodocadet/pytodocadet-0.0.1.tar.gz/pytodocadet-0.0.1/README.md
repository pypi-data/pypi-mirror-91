# PyToDoCADET

Here is a simple and robust "ToDo" application by me:)

## Installation

Run the following command to install:
$pip install pytodocadet

## Usage 

To run this program(GUI), you should open your terminal
    or CMD. Then navigate to the folder that contains this package.
It depends on where you installed.
I recommend that you create a virtual environment before you install.
So that you can easily find and run the program.

## About the Program

PyToDoCadet is a QT based "ToDo" application that is written in Python.
You can easily create new task. 
Tasks are DRAG-DROP enabled. So you can pass it through another place that
    you specified for 'under construction' or 'Done'.
Also you can give an importance level to any task that you selected before.
You can delete any task you selected.
Also you can clear all the task from the program.
Last but not least, the program remembers the last state when you close it.
So you will never lost your task.
(Before closing, program will ask you if you want to save or not.
    When you selected yes, PyToDoCadet will show your tasks.)

HAVE FUN and DON'T FORGET TO GIVE ME A STAR!!!
