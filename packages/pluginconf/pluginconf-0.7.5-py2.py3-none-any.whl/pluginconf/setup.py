# description: utilizes PMD to populate some package fields
# version: 0.3
# license: PD
#
# Utilizes plugin meta data to cut down setup.py incantations
# to basically just:
#
#     from pluginconf.setup import setup
#     setup(
#         fn="pluginconf/__init__.py",
#         long_description="@README.rst"
#     )
#
# Where the fn= either pinpoints the main invocation point,
# when name= or packages= (implicitly from `find_packages()`)
# don't specify a locatable script already.
#
# Mapped meta fields include:
#
#     # description: …
#     # version: …
#     # url: …
#     # depends: python (>= 2.7), python:pkg-name (>= 1.0)
#     # suggests: python:extras_require (>= 1.0)
#     # author: …
#     # license: spdx
#     # state: stable
#     # type: classifier
#     # category: classifier
#     # keywords: tag, tag
#     # classifiers: tag, trove, shortcuts
#    
# A long_description=README.* will be read automatically,
# else the default PMD comment gets used.
# Classifiers and license matching is very crude, just for
# the most common cases.
