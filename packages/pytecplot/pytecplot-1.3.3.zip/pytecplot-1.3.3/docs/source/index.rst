|PyTecplot|: |Tecplot 360| Python Library
============================================

The pytecplot library is a high level API that connects your Python script to
the power of the |Tecplot 360| visualization engine. It offers line plotting,
2D and 3D surface plots in a variety of formats, and 3D volumetric
visualization. Familiarity with |Tecplot 360| and the |Tecplot 360| macro
language is helpful, but not required.

.. note::
    |PyTecplot| requires 64-bit Python and |Tecplot 360| with |TecPLUS|
    maintenance service. |PyTecplot| does not support 32 bit Python. Please
    refer to `Installation` for installation instructions, environment setup
    and system requirements. For the best experience, developers are encouraged
    to use the **latest version of Python**. If you need help converting to
    Python 3 or wish to write code compatible with 2 and 3, please refer to the
    `Python-Future Cheat Sheet
    <http://python-future.org/compatible_idioms.html>`_.
