# Documentation Examples

The files under this directory are stand-alone executable Python scripts which
are embedded into the PyTecplot API docstrings and HTML reference pages. They
do not contain much documentation themselves, but are meant to be here mostly
for the convenience of testing the code. That said, they may still be useful
to learn about various parts of the PyTecplot API.
