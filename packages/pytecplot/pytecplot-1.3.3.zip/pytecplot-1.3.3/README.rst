PyTecplot
=========

The pytecplot library is a high level API that connects your Python script
to the power of the |Tecplot 360| visualization engine. It offers line
plotting, 2D and 3D surface plots in a variety of formats, and 3D volumetric
visualization. Familiarity with |Tecplot 360| and the |Tecplot 360|
macro language is helpful, but not required.

Documentation
-------------

The full documentation is here: http://www.tecplot.com/docs/pytecplot

.. note::
    |PyTecplot| supports 64-bit Python 3.7 or later. |PyTecplot| does not
    support 32 bit Python. Please refer to INSTALL.rst for installation
    instructions and environment setup. For the best experience, developers are
    encouraged to use the **latest version of Python**.

Quick Start
-----------

Please refer to the documentation for detailed installation instructions and
environment setup. The short of it is something like this::

    pip install pytecplot

Linux and OSX users may have to set ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` or
``DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to the directories containing the |Tecplot 360|
dynamic libraries. Please refer to the documentation at
http://www.tecplot.com/docs/pytecplot for detailed information regarding setup

Change Log
----------

PyTecplot 1.3.3
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Minor changes to documentation and packaging.

PyTecplot 1.3.1
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released with Tecplot 360 2020 R2

* New method: ``tp.data.extract.extract_connected_regions()`` to create zones
  from contiguous regions.
* Fixed a crash on exit when running in a MacOS virtual machine.
* Several minor documentation corrections.

PyTecplot 1.3.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released with Tecplot 360 2020 R1

* Fixed ``probe_on_surface()`` tolerance behavior for skewed cells.
* New methods: export of time-series animation videos.
* Current FEA loader version updated to v450.
* Fixed bug around setting axis ranges before data is loaded.

PyTecplot 1.2.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* New loader: Converge HDF5 data files.
* New feature: Slice collections class through ``plot.slices()`` which
  simplifies and optimizes manipulating many slice groups at once.
* New method: Slice clipping.
* New methods: Transform array data from spherical or poler to rectagular and
  back.
* New method: ``tp.data.operate.smooth()`` for in-place transformation of field
  data.
* New method: ``tp.data.extract.triangulate()`` for 2D source zones.
* Fixed internal state-change behavior during suspend context.
* Fixed memory leaks around dynamic loading of libraries.
* Renaming and deprecation: ``Fieldmap.show_iso_surface`` has been deprecated
  and renamed to ``Fieldmap.show_isosurface``.
* Deprecated from 2D plot types: properties ``show_slices``,
  ``show_streamtraces`` and ``show_iso_surfaces`` are now only accessible from
  the 3D plot type.
* Several improvements to documentation and installation notes.

These methods and improvements will require either the April 2020 Beta or the
upcoming release of Tecplot 360 2020 R1:

* macOS: PyTecplot in batch mode can now export images with Python as installed
  by Brew or MacPorts.
* New method: ``tp.data.extract.extract_blanked_zones()``.
* Even vector spacing API: ``plot.vector.use_even_spacing``.
* Better API coverage by python recorder.

PyTecplot 1.1.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* Officially supported Python versions are now 2.7 and 3.6+.
* Added support for Python 3.8 on all platforms. Windows batch-mode with Python
  3.8+ now requires PyTecplot version 1.1 or later.
* New feature: Fieldmap and Linemap collections classes through
  ``plot.fieldmaps()`` and ``plot.linemaps()`` which simplifies and optimizes
  manipulating many fieldmaps or linemaps at once.
* New option to close (quit) Tecplot 360 on disconnect.
* New position and size parameters for ``add_frame()``.
* New IJK range parameters for ``copy_zones()`` and ``Zone.copy()``.
* Bug fix: tp.data.operate.execute_equation() now uses zero-based indexing for
  IJK range parameters.
* Bug fix: ``IndexRange`` max value of zero is now interpreted as the first
  index in the range instead of the last index.
* Many documentation and example script updates and fixes.

PyTecplot 1.0.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released with Tecplot 360 2019 R1

* This is the first release of a guaranteed-stable interface of PyTecplot.
  Following this, the API will adhere closely to the guidelines enumerated
  by `Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 <https://semver.org>`_.
* Deprecation warnings from previous versions have been elevated to errors.
* Setting field data now unravels multidimensional arrays automatically,
  removing the need for the user to do this in client code.
* New methods for exporting to BMP and EPS image formats.
* New interfaces for linking style between and within frames.
* New method for mirroring zones: ``Dataset.mirror_zones()``.
* Telemac data loader: tp.data.load_telemac(), requires Tecplot 360 2019 R1 or
  later.
* New loader interfaces for CFX, Ensight, OpenFOAM, STL and VTK.
* SZL Server loader: tp.data.load_tecplot_szl() now fully supports SZL server.
* Several documentation and example script updates and fixes.

PyTecplot 0.14.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* New annotation objects: geometric shapes, poly-lines, images, georeferenced
  images and LaTeX.
* New interface for value blanking.
* New interface for scatter symbols, RGB coloring, data labels and light source.
* New animation export defaults: all frames, width: 800 px, supersample: 3.
* Reverse indexing (negative indices counting from the end) for linemap,
  fieldmap and solution_timestep.
* Regex pattern search for pages, frames, linemaps, zones and variables.
* Interface change: getting a single page, frame, linemap, zone or variable
  by name no longer raises and exception if no match is found. Instead the
  methods emit a warning and return None.
* Setting array data from Python into PyTecplot now orders of magnitude faster
  if Numpy is installed for batch-mode.
* New property: ``Variable.lock_mode`` to get lock status of the variable.
* New multiprocessing examples.
* Several documentation corrections and minor fixes.
* Removed: slice and isosurface properties are 3D only and have now been
  removed from the Cartesian2DFieldPlot class.

PyTecplot 0.12.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released with Tecplot 360 2018 R2.1

* New: direct support for frame-by-frame and transient (solution time-based) animations.
* Bug fix: Dataset.copy_zones() now copies all zones by default.
* Better PyTecplot Connections exception handling.
* Updated installation documentation addressing differences between batch and connected modes.
* Removed from API: ``PolarView.reset_to_entire_circle()``. Scripts should use
  ``PolarLineAxis.reset_to_entire_circle()`` instead.
* Fixed recording of PyTecplot copy/paste frame.
* Added ability for PyTecplot to subsequently acquire a license if the first attempt
  failed due to contention.

PyTecplot 0.11.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released with Tecplot 360 2018 R2

* FVCOM data loader: tp.data.load_fvcom(), requires Tecplot 360 2018 R2 and later.
* New properties of the Dataset: ``zone_names`` and ``variable_names`` returning lists of names.
* Performance: tp.session.suspend() context now delays GUI updates during complex operations. This
  is now fully supported with Tecplot 360 2018 R2 and later.
* Performance: The underlying protocol for connect mode has changed to "Protocol Buffers" by
  Google. PyTecplot is still backwards compatible with the previous versions of the TecUtil Server,
  but newer versions of Tecplot 360 will now require PyTecplot 0.11 or later.
* Import of the ``tecplot`` Python module is now "on-demand" and should be faster for most users.
