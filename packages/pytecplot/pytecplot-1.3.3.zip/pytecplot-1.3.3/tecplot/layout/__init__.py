"""Pages, frames and other layout-related operations.

The "layout" consists of a stack of `Pages <Page>` identified by index or
`name <Page.name>`. Each `Page` consists of a single "workspace" which holds
a collection of `Frames <Frame>` that are laid out in relation to an area
called the `Paper`.

The |Tecplot Engine| is guaranteed to have at least one `Page` which is
holding onto at least one `Frame`. It also has the concept of an active
`Frame` and by extension, an active `Page`. Most, if not all operations
that require a handle to a `Frame` will use the active `Frame` by default.
This includes any function that operates on objects held by a `Frame`
such as a `Cartesian3DFieldPlot` or `Dataset`.
