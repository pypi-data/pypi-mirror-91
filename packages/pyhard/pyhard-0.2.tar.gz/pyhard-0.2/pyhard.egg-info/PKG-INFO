Description: # pyhard
        
        __Instance Hardness Python package__.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        Python 3.7 is required. Matlab is also required in order to run [matilda](https://matilda.unimelb.edu.au/matilda/). As far as we know, only recent versions of Matlab offer an engine for Python 3. Namely, we have tested only version R2020a.
        
        ### Installation
        1. __Clone repository__
        ```
        git clone https://gitlab.com/ita-ml/instance-hardness.git
        ```
        
        2. __Install package via pip__
        ```
        cd instance-hardness/
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        3. __Install Matlab engine for Python__  
        Refer to this [link](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_external/install-the-matlab-engine-for-python.html), which contains detailed instructions.
        
        ### Usage
        
        In the command line (terminal):
        
        ```
        cd your/path/instance-hardness
        python pyhard
        ```
        
        It should generate the `metadata.csv` file and run the matilda software.
        
        ### Configuration
        
        See the file `config.yaml` in `/instance-hardness/conf/`. It contains options for file paths, measures to be calculated, which classifiers to use and their parametrization.
