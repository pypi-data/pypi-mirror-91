# K8s deployer

This repository implementes helpers for the programmatic deployment of K8s resources on a cluster.

The core of the logic is contained in the ```k8s_yaml_obj.py```, which implements classes for relevant YAML elements on K8s resources.

The generated YAML files can be then normally used through ```kubectl``` inline commands or within the desired script.

## Pypi Installation
The core can also be installed as pypi package: `pip install k8syaml`
