Description: # pip-licenses-reader
        
        The pip-licenses-reader provides a simple reader for JSON files generated by [pip-licenses](https://pypi.org/project/pip-licenses/). 
        
        ## Setting up the data
        
        Create a file called `bill_of_materials.json` using the following command:
        
        ```shell
          pip-licenses --format=json --output-file=bill_of_materials.json --with-authors --with-urls
        ```
        
        and place it next to your start-up script.
        
        **NOTE**: If you use another file name or location, the file path must set at run-time.
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```pyhton
        from pip_licenses_reader import read_file
        
        license_collection = read_file()
        ```
        
        The resulting element will be read-only. It provides a value called `projects`, which is iterable. For each item, the following properties are set:
        
        - author
        - name
        - url
        - version (as `packaging.version.Version` from `setuptools` or `packaging`)
        - license
        
        Hence, the data can be considered as bill of materials for your project, if it was created from a virtual env.
        
        If you used another file path or name, this can be passed as the first argument called `file`.
        
        Errors will be logged using the a regular `Logger` from pythons `logging` module.
