        in create or update request.

        was created. It is not guaranteed to be set in happens-before order across
        separate operations. Clients may not set this value. It is represented in
        RFC3339 form and is in UTC.

        will be removed from the system. Only set when deletionTimestamp is also set.
        May only be shortened. Read-only.
      * **deletionTimestamp** ``Time`` - *(optional)* DeletionTimestamp is RFC 3339 date and time at which this resource will be
        deleted. This field is set by the server when a graceful deletion is requested
        by the user, and is not directly settable by a client. The resource is
        expected to be deleted (no longer visible from resource lists, and not
        reachable by name) after the time in this field, once the finalizers list is
        empty. As long as the finalizers list contains items, deletion is blocked.
        Once the deletionTimestamp is set, this value may not be unset or be set
        further into the future, although it may be shortened or the resource may be
        deleted prior to this time. For example, a user may request that a pod is
        deleted in 30 seconds. The Kubelet will react by sending a graceful
        termination signal to the containers in the pod. After that 30 seconds, the
        Kubelet will send a hard termination signal (SIGKILL) to the container and
        after cleanup, remove the pod from the API. In the presence of network
        partitions, this object may still exist after this timestamp, until an
        administrator or automated process can determine the resource is fully
        terminated. If not set, graceful deletion of the object has not been
        requested.
        Populated by the system when a graceful deletion is requested. Read-only. More
        info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * **finalizers** ``List[str]`` - *(optional)* Must be empty before the object is deleted from the registry. Each entry is an
        identifier for the responsible component that will remove the entry from the
        list. If the deletionTimestamp of the object is non-nil, entries in this list
        can only be removed. Finalizers may be processed and removed in any order.
        Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck
        finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can
        reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to
        a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the
        list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced
        by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a
        deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst
        themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.
      * **generateName** ``str`` - *(optional)* GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique
        name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided. If this field is used, the
        name returned to the client will be different than the name passed. This value
        will also be combined with a unique suffix. The provided value has the same
        validation rules as the Name field, and may be truncated by the length of the
        suffix required to make the value unique on the server.
        If this field is specified and the generated name exists, the server will NOT
        return a 409 - instead, it will either return 201 Created or 500 with Reason
        ServerTimeout indicating a unique name could not be found in the time
        allotted, and the client should retry (optionally after the time indicated in
        the Retry-After header).

      * **labels** ``dict`` - *(optional)* Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
        (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers and
        services. More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/labels
      * **managedFields** ``List[ManagedFieldsEntry]`` - *(optional)* ManagedFields maps workflow-id and version to the set of fields that are
        managed by that workflow. This is mostly for internal housekeeping, and users
        typically shouldn't need to set or understand this field. A workflow can be
        the user's name, a controller's name, or the name of a specific apply path
        like "ci-cd". The set of fields is always in the version that the workflow
        used when modifying the object.
      * **name** ``str`` - *(optional)* Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources,
        although some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an
        appropriate name automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation
        idempotence and configuration definition. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
      * **namespace** ``str`` - *(optional)* Namespace defines the space within each name must be unique. An empty
        namespace is equivalent to the "default" namespace, but "default" is the
        canonical representation. Not all objects are required to be scoped to a
        namespace - the value of this field for those objects will be empty.
        Must be a DNS_LABEL. Cannot be updated. More info:
        http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/namespaces
      * **ownerReferences** ``List[OwnerReference]`` - *(optional)* List of objects depended by this object. If ALL objects in the list have been
        deleted, this object will be garbage collected. If this object is managed by a
        controller, then an entry in this list will point to this controller, with the
        controller field set to true. There cannot be more than one managing
        controller.
      * **resourceVersion** ``str`` - *(optional)* An opaque value that represents the internal version of this object that can
        be used by clients to determine when objects have changed. May be used for
        optimistic concurrency, change detection, and the watch operation on a
        resource or set of resources. Clients must treat these values as opaque and
        passed unmodified back to the server. They may only be valid for a particular
        resource or set of resources.
        Populated by the system. Read-only. Value must be treated as opaque by clients

        generated by the server on successful creation of a resource and is not
        allowed to change on PUT operations.
