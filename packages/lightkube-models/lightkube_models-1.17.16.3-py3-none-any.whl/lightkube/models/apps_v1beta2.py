      ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data. Clients are
      responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects that contain their
      internal state. Once a ControllerRevision has been successfully created, it
      can not be updated. The API Server will fail validation of all requests that
      attempt to mutate the Data field. ControllerRevisions may, however, be
      deleted. Note that, due to its use by both the DaemonSet and StatefulSet
      controllers for update and rollback, this object is beta. However, it may be
      subject to name and representation changes in future releases, and clients
      should not depend on its stability. It is primarily for internal use by
      controllers.
