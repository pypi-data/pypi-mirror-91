class RuntimeClass(DataclassDictMixIn):
    """RuntimeClass defines a class of container runtime supported in the cluster.
      The RuntimeClass is used to determine which container runtime is used to run
      all containers in a pod. RuntimeClasses are (currently) manually defined by a
      user or cluster provisioner, and referenced in the PodSpec. The Kubelet is
      responsible for resolving the RuntimeClassName reference before running the
      pod.  For more details, see
      https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/runtime-class.md

      **parameters**

      * **handler** ``str`` - Handler specifies the underlying runtime and configuration that the CRI
        implementation will use to handle pods of this class. The possible values are
        specific to the node & CRI configuration.  It is assumed that all handlers are
        available on every node, and handlers of the same name are equivalent on every
        node. For example, a handler called "runc" might specify that the runc OCI
        runtime (using native Linux containers) will be used to run the containers in
        a pod. The Handler must conform to the DNS Label (RFC 1123) requirements, and
        is immutable.
      * **apiVersion** ``str`` - *(optional)* APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
        Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
        may reject unrecognized values. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
      * **kind** ``str`` - *(optional)* Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
        Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
        Cannot be updated. In CamelCase. More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
      * **metadata** ``meta_v1.ObjectMeta`` - *(optional)* More info:
        https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#metadata
      * **overhead** ``Overhead`` - *(optional)* Overhead represents the resource overhead associated with running a pod for a
        given RuntimeClass. For more details, see
        https://git.k8s.io/enhancements/keps/sig-node/20190226-pod-overhead.md This
        field is alpha-level as of Kubernetes v1.15, and is only honored by servers
        that enable the PodOverhead feature.
      * **scheduling** ``Scheduling`` - *(optional)* Scheduling holds the scheduling constraints to ensure that pods running with
        this RuntimeClass are scheduled to nodes that support it. If scheduling is
        nil, this RuntimeClass is assumed to be supported by all nodes.
