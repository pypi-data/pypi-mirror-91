class JobSpec(DataclassDictMixIn):
    """JobSpec describes how the job execution will look like.

      **parameters**

      * **template** ``core_v1.PodTemplateSpec`` - Describes the pod that will be created when executing a job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **activeDeadlineSeconds** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the duration in seconds relative to the startTime that the job may
        be active before the system tries to terminate it; value must be positive
        integer
      * **backoffLimit** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the number of retries before marking this job failed. Defaults to 6
      * **completions** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the desired number of successfully finished pods the job should be
        run with.  Setting to nil means that the success of any pod signals the
        success of all pods, and allows parallelism to have any positive value.
        Setting to 1 means that parallelism is limited to 1 and the success of that
        pod signals the success of the job. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **manualSelector** ``bool`` - *(optional)* manualSelector controls generation of pod labels and pod selectors. Leave
        `manualSelector` unset unless you are certain what you are doing. When false
        or unset, the system pick labels unique to this job and appends those labels
        to the pod template.  When true, the user is responsible for picking unique
        labels and specifying the selector.  Failure to pick a unique label may cause
        this and other jobs to not function correctly.  However, You may see
        `manualSelector=true` in jobs that were created with the old
        `extensions/v1beta1` API. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/#specifying-your-own-pod-selector
      * **parallelism** ``int`` - *(optional)* Specifies the maximum desired number of pods the job should run at any given
        time. The actual number of pods running in steady state will be less than this
        number when ((.spec.completions - .status.successful) < .spec.parallelism),
        i.e. when the work left to do is less than max parallelism. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/jobs-run-to-completion/
      * **selector** ``meta_v1.LabelSelector`` - *(optional)* A label query over pods that should match the pod count. Normally, the system
        sets this field for you. More info:
        https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/labels/#label-selectors
      * **ttlSecondsAfterFinished** ``int`` - *(optional)* ttlSecondsAfterFinished limits the lifetime of a Job that has finished
        execution (either Complete or Failed). If this field is set,
        ttlSecondsAfterFinished after the Job finishes, it is eligible to be
        automatically deleted. When the Job is being deleted, its lifecycle guarantees
        (e.g. finalizers) will be honored. If this field is unset, the Job won't be
        automatically deleted. If this field is set to zero, the Job becomes eligible
        to be deleted immediately after it finishes. This field is alpha-level and is
        only honored by servers that enable the TTLAfterFinished feature.
