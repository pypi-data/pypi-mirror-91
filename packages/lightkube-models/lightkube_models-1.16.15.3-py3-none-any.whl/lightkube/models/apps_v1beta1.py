      ControllerRevision implements an immutable snapshot of state data. Clients are
      responsible for serializing and deserializing the objects that contain their
      internal state. Once a ControllerRevision has been successfully created, it
      can not be updated. The API Server will fail validation of all requests that
      attempt to mutate the Data field. ControllerRevisions may, however, be
      deleted. Note that, due to its use by both the DaemonSet and StatefulSet
      controllers for update and rollback, this object is beta. However, it may be
      subject to name and representation changes in future releases, and clients
      should not depend on its stability. It is primarily for internal use by
      controllers.

        "pod-specific-string" is managed by the StatefulSet controller.

        insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet

        individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults

        maintained in the StatefulSet's revision history. The revision history
        consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied
        StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.

      **parameters**

      * **replicas** ``int`` - replicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller.
      * **collisionCount** ``int`` - *(optional)* collisionCount is the count of hash collisions for the StatefulSet. The
        StatefulSet controller uses this field as a collision avoidance mechanism when
        it needs to create the name for the newest ControllerRevision.
      * **conditions** ``List[StatefulSetCondition]`` - *(optional)* Represents the latest available observations of a statefulset's current state.
      * **currentReplicas** ``int`` - *(optional)* currentReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller
        from the StatefulSet version indicated by currentRevision.
      * **currentRevision** ``str`` - *(optional)* currentRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used
        to generate Pods in the sequence [0,currentReplicas).
      * **observedGeneration** ``int`` - *(optional)* observedGeneration is the most recent generation observed for this
        StatefulSet. It corresponds to the StatefulSet's generation, which is updated
        on mutation by the API Server.
      * **readyReplicas** ``int`` - *(optional)* readyReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller that
        have a Ready Condition.
      * **updateRevision** ``str`` - *(optional)* updateRevision, if not empty, indicates the version of the StatefulSet used to
        generate Pods in the sequence [replicas-updatedReplicas,replicas)
      * **updatedReplicas** ``int`` - *(optional)* updatedReplicas is the number of Pods created by the StatefulSet controller
        from the StatefulSet version indicated by updateRevision.
