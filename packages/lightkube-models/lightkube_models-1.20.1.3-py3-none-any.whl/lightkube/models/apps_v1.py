        insufficient replicas are detected. Each pod stamped out by the StatefulSet
        will fulfill this Template, but have a unique identity from the rest of the
        StatefulSet.
      * **podManagementPolicy** ``str`` - *(optional)* podManagementPolicy controls how pods are created during initial scale up,
        when replacing pods on nodes, or when scaling down. The default policy is
        `OrderedReady`, where pods are created in increasing order (pod-0, then pod-1,
        etc) and the controller will wait until each pod is ready before continuing.
        When scaling down, the pods are removed in the opposite order. The alternative
        policy is `Parallel` which will create pods in parallel to match the desired
        scale without waiting, and on scale down will delete all pods at once.
      * **replicas** ``int`` - *(optional)* replicas is the desired number of replicas of the given Template. These are
        replicas in the sense that they are instantiations of the same Template, but
        individual replicas also have a consistent identity. If unspecified, defaults
        to 1.

        consists of all revisions not represented by a currently applied
        StatefulSetSpec version. The default value is 10.

        to update Pods in the StatefulSet when a revision is made to Template.
      * **volumeClaimTemplates** ``List[core_v1.PersistentVolumeClaim]`` - *(optional)* volumeClaimTemplates is a list of claims that pods are allowed to reference.
