Description: Name - Implementation of basic ml algorithms Author - mr_frozen97 This is a library that does all the heavy lifting for the basic ml algorithms such as regression, knn, svm, etc.
        But, currently this has only linear regression. The speciality about this library is you can plot the outcomes on graph in a single line using class included in the
        library. Which is fed with default parameters. Which you can change according to your requirements.It uses the following libraries 1) Numpy 2) Matplotlib 3) Random
