# The immunopeptidomic toolkit library, IPTK # 

### Introduction and Project Aim ###
<p>IPTK is a Python library specialized in the analysis of HLA-peptidomes identified through an Immunopeptidomic(IP) pipeline. 
The library provides a high level API for analyzing and visualizing the identified peptides, integrating transcritomics and protein structure information 
for a rich analysis of the identified immunopeptidomes. It also provides a toolbox for integrating and comparing different experiments and/or different runs.</p>

### Release 0.4.0 notice:
<p> 1- Adding function to compute immunopeptiomic coverage matrix </p>
<p> 2- Introducing MDS plots for comparing the similarities between runs based on immunopeptidomic coverage </p>   

### Tutorials ### 
<p>The library have three notebooks that provide a step be step guidance to use the library and to utilize its major APIs for interacting with an IPs data.
These Tutorial can be found at the Tutorial directory</p>

<p> IPTK have be documented using Sphinx, the manual of the library can be found at docs directory and online at <a href= "https://iptk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"> readthedocs </a> </p> 


### Installation ###
<p>The library can be installed using pip as follows: </p> 

```
pip install iptkl --user
```


### Funding ###
The project was funded by the German Research Foundation (DFG) (Research Training Group 1743, ‘Genes, Environment and Inflammation’)
