PyMed is a Python library that provides access to PubMed through the
PubMed API. This is a fork, maintained by https://IPLweb.pl

Why this library?
-----------------

The PubMed API is not very well documented and querying it in a
performant way is too complicated and time consuming for researchers.
This wrapper provides access to the API in a consistent, readable and
performant way.

Features
--------

This library takes care of the following for you:

-  Querying the PubMed database (with the standard PubMed query
   language)
-  Batching of requests for better performance
-  Parsing and cleaning of the retrieved articles

Examples
--------

For full (working) examples have a look at the ``examples/`` folder in
this repository. In essence you only need to import the ``PubMed``
class, instantiate it, and use it to query:

.. code:: python

   from pymed import PubMed
   pubmed = PubMed(tool="MyTool", email="my@email.address")
   results = pubmed.query("Some query", max_results=500)

Notes on the API
----------------

The original documentation of the PubMed API can be found here: `PubMed
Central <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/developers/>`__. PubMed
Central kindly requests you to:

   -  Do not make concurrent requests, even at off-peak times; and
   -  Include two parameters that help to identify your service or
      application to our servers

      -  *tool* should be the name of the application, as a string value
         with no internal spaces, and
      -  *email* should be the e-mail address of the maintainer of the
         tool, and should be a valid e-mail address.
