    A Python library that provides an interface to communicate with IBM hosts: send commands and text, receive output (screens). 
    The library is built on a 3270 emulator, but adapted for the 5250 protocol used by AS400 and IBM i.

    The library is highly customizable and is built with simplicity in mind.
    It is written in Python 3, runs on Linux and Unix-like Operating Systems, and relies on the `s3270` utility. So it is required to have the `s3270` installed on your system and available on your PATH.

    The library allows you to open a telnet connection to an IBM host, and execute a set of instructions as you specified them in your python program.
