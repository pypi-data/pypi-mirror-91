# A Python library to access IBM i / AS400 hosts with a TN5250 emulator.

This is library is built relying on first of all the `s3270` utility. It is required to have the `s3270` installed on your system - you can learn more here: [http://x3270.bgp.nu/](http://x3270.bgp.nu/)
Second, it relies on the P3270 python library. Credit goes to the original developer **Mossaab Stiri**, his code is available at [https://github.com/mstiri/p3270](https://github.com/mstiri/p3270) and it can be found at [PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/p3270/). As the P3270 library was a bit behind, I have added a lot of functionality and the updated version can for now be found here: [https://github.com/simonfaltum/p3270](https://github.com/simonfaltum/p3270). 

Most of the functionality is the same from the 3270 to the 5250 protocol. For example, moving the cursor, sending text or pressing enter. 
However, to get access to some of the more advanced functionality in the 5250 protocol, I have used IBM's own keymapping documentation [3270 keyboard mapping for Telnet servers](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/ssw_ibm_i_74/rzaiw/rzaiwkeybrdmap3270.htm). 



## Installation
A simple pip command brings the library to your environment: 

```pip install p3270```

__NB__: Make sure that you're using the python3 version of the pip command. 


## Usage 
Import the client class from the library:
```python 
from p5250 import P5250Client
```

Create a client object with the config options stated in the code.
```python 
my_client = P5250Client(hostName='localhost', path='c:\\wc3270\\', codePage='cp277')
```

If the s3270 program is downloaded as a .zip file or otherwise fails to be added to the path when installed, it is possible to state the path when creating the P3270Client. Otherwise, if s3270 is in the path, it is not needed.

Connect the client, and you're good to go:
```python
if not my_client.connect():
    print('Connection failed !')
    exit(1)

# Start sending your commands to the host ...
```

- `readTextAtPosition`, `readTextArea`, `getScreen` all return the text they read.

```python
from p5250 import P5250Client

# Connect and test if connection succeeded or not
if not my_client.connect():
    print('Connection failed !')
    exit(1)

# Save the home screen to a file called 'home.html'. HTML format is the default.
my_client.saveScreen(fileName='home.html')
