collective.iconifiedcategory
==============================================================================

This product will let you categorize created content using a category identified by an icon.

A dexterity behavior can be enabled and will add a field "content category" that will list available categories defined in a configuration.

So you first have to define the categories by adding a ContentCategoryConfiguration somewhere.  Then add a CategoryGroup on which some extra features may be activated :

- is content confidential?
- is content an element to print?
- is content an element to sign?

If activated, these fields will be available on the content using the behavior.

Then into a CategoryGroup, you will be able to add ContentCategory that are characterized by a title and an icon.  These ContentCategory elements will be the terms of a vocabulary used to select a category on a content using the behavior.

This package is widely overridable and is made to manage many usecases of iconified categories.

A element that contains categorized content will display a special widget where categorized content are grouped by ContentCategory behind an icon.

A table view is also available listing categorized contents with more details.
