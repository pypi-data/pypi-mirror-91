# hypothesis-asn1

A [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.readthedocs.io) strategy for generating data
that matches some [ASN.1 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASN.1).

[Here's the PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/hypothesis-asn1/) and
[the GitHub repo](https://github.com/Zac-HD/hypothesis-asn1).

## API

`hypothesis-asn1` is in the planning stages, so there is no public API yet.

## Supported versions

`hypothesis-asn1` requires Python 3.6 or later.
In general, 0.x versions will require very recent versions of all dependencies
because I don't want to deal with compatibility workarounds.


## Changelog

Patch notes [can be found in `CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/Zac-HD/hypothesis-asn1/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
