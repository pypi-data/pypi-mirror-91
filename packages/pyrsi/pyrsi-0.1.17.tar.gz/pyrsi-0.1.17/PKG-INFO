        ==========
        
        A community made Python API for interactive with the Roberts Space Industries site for Star Citizen.
        
        .. warning:: This API is in it's very early stages and will change often.

        Examples
        --------
        
        Getting system status:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from rsi.status import Status
           s = Status()
           current_status = s.system()
           recent_incidents = s.timeline()
           specific_incident = s.incident('28f92e5a')
        
        
        Getting Roadmap information:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from datetime import datetime
            from rsi.roadmap import Roadmap
            r = Roadmap()
            cur_roadmap = r.fetch_roadmap(start_date=datetime(year=2021, month=1, day=1),
                                          end_date=datetime(year=2021, month=12, day=31))
        
        Accessing ship information:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from rsi.shipmatrix import ShipMatrixAPI
            ship_matrix = ShipMatrixAPI()
            ship = ship_matrix.ships[170]      # ships is a dictionary, keys are ship IDs
            ship = ship_matrix.search_by_name('kraken')
        
        Accessing citizen information:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from rsi.citizen import fetch_citizen
            fetch_citizen('ventorvar')
        
        Accessing org information:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from rsi.org import OrgAPI
            org = OrgAPI('EXTERRA')
            member = org.members[0]
        
        Accessing admin org information for an organization that you have the Officer or Founder role for.
        This let's you see the member information for hidden members.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
            from rsi.org import OrgAPI
            org = OrgAPI('EXTERRA', admin_mode=True, username=username, password=password)
            member = org.members[0]
            members = org.search('fuzzy_handle_matching')     # list of members using fuzzy matching
            member = org.search_one('fuzzy_handle_matching')  # returns only the top match
