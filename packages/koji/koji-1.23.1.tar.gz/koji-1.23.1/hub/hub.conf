## ConfigParser style config file, similar to ini files
## https://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html
##
## Note that multiline values can be set by indenting subsequent lines
## (which means you should not indent regular lines)

##  Basic options  ##
DBName = koji
DBUser = koji
#DBHost = db.example.com
#DBPort = 5432
#Note, that db password is sensitive and this file shouldn't be publicly readable.
#DBPass = example_password
KojiDir = /mnt/koji

##  Auth-related options  ##
# Use user IP in session management
# CheckClientIP = True

##  Kerberos authentication options  ##

# AuthPrincipal = host/kojihub@EXAMPLE.COM
# AuthKeytab = /etc/koji.keytab
# ProxyPrincipals = koji/kojiweb@EXAMPLE.COM
## format string for host principals (%s = hostname)
# HostPrincipalFormat = compile/%s@EXAMPLE.COM
## Allowed Kerberos Realms separated by ','.
## Default value "*" indicates any Realm is allowed
# AllowedKrbRealms = *
## TODO: this option should be removed in future release
# DisableGSSAPIProxyDNFallback = False

## end Kerberos auth configuration



##  SSL client certificate auth configuration  ##
#note: ssl auth may also require editing the httpd config (conf.d/kojihub.conf)

## the client username is the common name of the subject of their client certificate
# DNUsernameComponent = CN
## separate multiple DNs with |
# ProxyDNs = /C=US/ST=Massachusetts/O=Example Org/OU=Example User/CN=example/emailAddress=example@example.com

## end SSL client certificate auth configuration



##  Other options  ##
LoginCreatesUser = On
KojiWebURL = http://kojiweb.example.com/koji
# The domain name that will be appended to Koji usernames
# when creating email notifications
#EmailDomain = example.com
# whether to send the task owner and package owner email or not on success.  this still goes to watchers
NotifyOnSuccess = True
## Disables all notifications
# DisableNotifications = False

##  Resource limits  ##
## All standard RLIMIT_* can be set here
# RLIMIT_AS =
# RLIMIT_CORE =
# RLIMIT_CPU =
# RLIMIT_DATA =
# RLIMIT_FSIZE =
# RLIMIT_MEMLOCK =
# RLIMIT_NOFILE =
# RLIMIT_NPROC =
# RLIMIT_OFILE =
# RLIMIT_RSS =
# RLIMIT_STACK =

## If memory consumption raises during handling request for more
## than MemoryWarnThreshold kilobytes, warning is emitted to log
# MemoryWarnThreshold = 5000

## Maximum request length can be limited on python-side
# MaxRequestLength = 4194304


## Extended features
## Support Maven builds
# EnableMaven = False
## Support Windows builds
# EnableWin = False

## Koji hub plugins
## The path where plugins are found
# PluginPath = /usr/lib/koji-hub-plugins
## A space-separated list of plugins to load
# Plugins = echo

## If KojiDebug is on, the hub will be /very/ verbose and will report exception
## details to clients for anticipated errors (i.e. koji's own exceptions --
## subclasses of koji.GenericError).
# KojiDebug = On
#
## Log level/format for python logging module at hub
# LogLevel = WARNING
# LogFormat = %(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] m=%(method)s u=%(user_name)s p=%(process)s r=%(remoteaddr)s %(name)s: %(message)s'
#
#
## If VerbosePolicy (or KojiDebug) is on, 'policy violation'
## messages will contain also policy rule which caused this denial
## VerbosePolicy = False
#
## If MissingPolicyOk is on, and given policy is not set up,
## policy test will pass as ok. If 'deny' result is desired, set it
## to off
# MissingPolicyOk = True
#
## Determines how much detail about exceptions is reported to the client (via faults)
## Meaningful values:
##   normal - a basic traceback (format_exception)
##   extended - an extended traceback (format_exc_plus)
##   anything else - no traceback, just the error message
## The extended traceback is intended for debugging only and should NOT be
## used in production, since it may contain sensitive information.
# KojiTraceback = normal

## These options are intended for planned outages
# ServerOffline = False
# OfflineMessage = temporary outage
# LockOut = False
## If ServerOffline is True, the server will always report a ServerOffline fault (with
## OfflineMessage as the fault string).
## If LockOut is True, the server will report a ServerOffline fault for all non-admin
## requests.
