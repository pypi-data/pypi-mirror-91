# Calendra documentation

## Overview

Calendra is a Python module that offers classes able to handle calendars, list legal / religious holidays and gives working-day-related computation functions.

##Â Status

This library is ready for production, although we may warn eventual users: some calendars may not be up-to-date, and this library doesn't cover all the existing countries on earth (yet).
