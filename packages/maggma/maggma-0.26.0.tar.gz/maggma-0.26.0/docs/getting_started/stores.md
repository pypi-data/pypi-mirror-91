# Using `Store`

A `Store` is just a wrapper to access data from somewhere. That somewhere is typically a MongoDB collection, but it could also be GridFS which lets you keep large binary objects. `maggma` makes GridFS and MongoDB collections feel the same. Beyond that it adds in something that looks like GridFS but is actually using AWS S3 as the storage space. Finally, `Store` can actually perform logic, concatenating two or more `Stores` together to make them look like one data source for instance. This means you only have to write a `Builder` for one scenario of how to transform data and the choice of `Store` lets you control where the data comes from and goes.

## List of Stores

Current working and tested Stores include:

- MongoStore: interfaces to a MongoDB Collection
- MongoURIStore: MongoDB Introduced advanced URIs including their special "mongodb+srv://" which uses a combination of SRV and TXT DNS records to fully setup the client. This store is to safely handle these kinds of URIs.
- MemoryStore: just a Store that exists temporarily in memory
- JSONStore: builds a MemoryStore and then populates it with the contents of the given JSON files
- GridFSStore: interfaces to GridFS collection in MongoDB
- MongograntStore: uses Mongogrant to get credentials for MongoDB database
- VaulStore: uses Vault to get credentials for a MongoDB database
- AliasingStore: aliases keys from the underlying store to new names
- SandboxStore: provides permission control to documents via a `_sbxn` sandbox key
- S3Store: provides an interface to an S3 Bucket either on AWS or self-hosted solutions
- JointStore: joins several MongoDB collections together, merging documents with the same `key`, so they look like one collection
- ConcatStore: concatenates several MongoDB collections in series so they look like one collection

## The `Store` interface

### Initializing a Store

All `Store`s have a few basic arguments that are critical to understand. Every `Store` has two attributes that the user should customize based on the data contained in that store: `key` and `last_updated_field`. The `key` defines how the `Store` tells documents part. Typically this is `_id` in MongoDB, but you could use your own field (be sure all values under the key field can be used to uniquely identify documents). `last_updated_field` tells `Store` how to order the documents by a date, which is typically in the `datetime` format, but can also be an ISO 8601-format (ex: `2009-05-28T16:15:00`) `Store`s can also take a `Validator` object to make sure the data going into obeys some schema.

### Using a Store

You must connect to a store by running `store.connect()` before querying and updating the store.
If you are operating on the stores inside of another code it is recommended to use the built-in context manager:

```python
with MongoStore(...) as store:
    store.query()
```

Stores provide a number of basic methods that make easy to use:

- query: Standard mongo style `find` method that lets you search the store.
- query_one: Same as above but limits returned results to just the first document that matches your query.
- update: Update the documents into the collection. This will override documents if the key field matches.
- ensure_index: This creates an index the underlying data-source for fast querying.
- distinct: Gets distinct values of a field.
- groupby: Similar to query but performs a grouping operation and returns sets of documents.
- remove_docs: Removes documents from the underlying data source.
- last_updated: Finds the most recently updated `last_updated_field` value and returns that. Useful for knowing how old a data-source is.
- newer_in: Finds all documents that are newer in the target collection and returns their `key`s. This is a very useful way of performing incremental processing.
