Description: # probadg Package
        
        
        This is a probability package that contains classes to create binomial and Gaussian distributions. It also contains a RandomObject class that simulates all the possible results of a binomial random variable, with their corresponding probabilities.
        
        Furthermore, it contains a function that simulates the Bayes Algorithm.
