# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## \[0.7.0\] \[2020-12-18\]

### Added
* Dependency `compas_mobile_robot_reloc` added as it is the broken out `localization`
module.

### Changed
* Bumped `compas_fab` to `v0.15.0`.
* Added attribute `skip` to `rapid_clay_formations_fab.fab_data.PlaceElement` to
replace use of attribute `placed`. `skip` is meant to be set for current run only.

### Removed
* `rapid_clay_formations_fab.localization` removed from package since it is now
* Removed `rapid_clay_formations_fab.utils.temp_change_compas_precision`.

## \[0.5.4\] \[2020-11-16\]

### Added
* Added `rhino_install` and `proxy` subcommands to command `rcf`.

### Changed
* `rapid_clay_formations_fab.robots.AbbRcfClient.check_reconnect` renamed to
`ensure_connection`. `ensure_connection` only restarts docker container once,
after that it tries pinging multiple times.
* `fab_conf.robot_client.speed.pick_place` split into two different key-values
pairs.

### Removed
* Removed kwarg `station_egress distance` and corresponding property
`station_egress_frame` from `rapid_clay_formations_fab.robots.PickStation`

## \[0.3.0\] \[2020-03-22\]

### Added

* ABB robot control example added to grasshopper examples.
* ``compas_rcf.abb.run`` documented under Usage in docs.

### Changed

* Second level imports implemented. So ``compas_rcf.fab_data.clay_objs.ClayBullet`` can be imported as ``compas_rcf.fab_data.ClayBullet``.
* Examples renamed to Usage in documentation.

* Merged ``compas_rcf.abb.helpers`` and ``compas_rcf.abb.connectivity`` to ``helpers``. So ``DOCKER_COMPOSE_PATHS``, ``ROBOT_IPS``, ``ping`` and ``check_reconnect`` can now be found in ``helpers``.
* ``compas_rcf``
* ``compas_rcf.fabrication.conf.ZONE_DICT`` moved to ``compas_rcf.abb.helpers.ZONE_DICT``
* A lot of changes to package structure. Might be documented here more later.

### Changed

* Replaced `pathlib` with `os.path` in `compas_rcf.abb.connectivity` for Python 2 compatibility.
* `compas_rcf.abb_runner` now writes progress to json while waiting for robot, to make sure the robot isn't idle between loops.
* Some improvements to the `compas_rcf.utils.csv_reports` module, more data points and more informative headers.

## \[0.2.3\] \[2020-03-11\]

### Added

* `compas_rcf.abb.helpers.RapidToolData` now takes optional tolerance for tooldata values.
* `compas_rcf.docker.docker_cmds._run` is a new helper function for docker commands that works in both Python 2 and 3.

-   Redone the reference pages in the docs and fixed import problems.
-   Replaced usage of `AttrDict` from `confuse.Configuration` in `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner` to use the original `confuse.Configuration` object. E.g. `fab_conf["target"].get()` instead of `fab_conf.target`. This is to make the use of the `Configuration` object uniform across modules.
-   `ZONE_DICT` moved from `compas_rcf.abb.helpers` to `compas_rcf.fabrication.conf`, mainly due to weird import errors.
-   `confuse.Template` object `confuse.Path` vendorised from upstream master and put in `compas_rcf.fabrication.conf`.

-   Added logging to `compas_rcf.abb.helpers`, `compas_rcf.fabrication.conf`, `compas_rcf.abb.programs`,
-   Directories set up previously by globals in `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner` is now accessible using the configuration file. The old globals are now the default value in the configuration.
-   Moved submodule `docker` from `compas_rcf.utils.docker` to `compas_rcf.docker` including its submodules and Docker-Compose files.
-   Refactored connection check from `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner` to its own function: `compas_rcf.abb.helpers.connection_check`.
-   Refactored logging setup from `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.abb_runner` to it's own function: `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.logging_setup`.
-   Refactored fabrication data analysis and prompts for skipping or placing bullets in `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.abb_runner` to its own function: `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.setup_fab_data`.

-   Moved `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.initial_setup` to: `compas_rcf.abb.programs.pre_procedure`.
-   Moved `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.shutdown_procedure` to: `compas_rcf.abb.programs.post_procedure`.
-   Moved `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.send_picking` to: `compas_rcf.abb.programs.pick_bullet`.
-   Moved `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.send_placing` to: `compas_rcf.abb.programs.place_bullet`.
-   Moved `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.send_grip_release` to: `compas_rcf.abb.programs.grip_and_release`.
-   Logging setup is now run in the `if __name__ = "__main__"` part of `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner`.

### Removed

-   Prompt to confirm settings removed in `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner.get_settings" in favour of a later confirmation of the whole setup in`abb\_run\`.

-   Removed print statements from `abb_runner` and replaced them with `logging.info` calls.
-   Fixed `id` attribute logic and renamed it to `bullet_id`. classmethod `compas_rcf.fabrication.clay_objs.ClayBullet.from_data` is backwards compatible.

## \[0.1.21\] \[2020-02-26\]

### Changed

-   `compas_rcf.fabrication.abb_runner` now prints progress updates to Flex pendant.
-   `abb_runner` now dumps list of `ClayBullets` for every bullet into file with same filename as input JSON but with IN\_PROGRESS added to start.
-   `abb_runner` now checks if attribute `placed` is set on `ClayBullet` and if so asks user if it should be skipped or placed (with the option to set skip and place for all future bullets with `placed` attribute). This file is deleted when script exits cleanly.
-   `compas_rcf.utils.csv_` renamed to `csv_reports`. Instead of a conversion tool it now creates an opinionated report from JSON file. It can also handle directories and multiple files as inputs.
