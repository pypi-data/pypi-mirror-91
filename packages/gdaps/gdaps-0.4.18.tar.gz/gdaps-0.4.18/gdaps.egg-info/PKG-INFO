Description: 
        The GDAPS library allows Django to make real "pluggable" apps.
        
        A standard Django "app" is *reusable* (if done correctly), but is not *pluggable*,
        like being distributed and "plugged" into a Django main application without modifications. GDAPS is filling this gap.
        
        The reason you want to use GDAPS is: **you want to create an application that should be extended via plugins**. GDAPS consists of a few bells and twistles where Django lacks "automagic":
        
        * Apps are automatically found using setuptools' entry points
        * Apps can provide their own URLs (they are included and merged into urlpatterns automatically)
        * Apps can define ``Interfaces``, that other GDAPS apps then can implement
        * Apps can provide Javascript frontends that are found and compiled automatically (WorkInProgress)
