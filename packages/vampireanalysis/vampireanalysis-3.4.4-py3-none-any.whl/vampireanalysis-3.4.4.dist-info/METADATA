# VAMPIRE (Visually Aided Morpho-Phenotyping Image Recognition)
**A robust method to quantify cell morphological heterogeneity**

1. System requirements\
    OS : Windows 10 (64 bit) Version 1909\
    Software is not compatible with older versions of Windows nor Mac.\
    Non-standard hardware is not required.

2. Installation Guide\
    No installation required. Open the executable file to launch the graphic user interface (GUI) of the software\
    It takes 20 seconds or less to initialize and launch the GUI.

3. Demo
    Instructions to run on data can be found in the Procedure section of the manuscript.\
    Expected output of the procedure is provided in the Figure 5 of the manuscript and also in the supplementary files.\
    Expected run time for demo :\
        Step 1-2, Segment cells or nuclei, 5~10 mins\
        Step 3, Create a list of images to build the shape-analysis model, 1-3 mins\
        Steps 4-9, Build shape-analysis model in VAMPIRE, 1-5 mins\
        Steps 10-12, Application of the model to analyze shapes across conditions, 1-5 mins\
        Total, steps 1-12, complete VAMPIRE analysis, 8-23 mins

4. Instructions for use
    Instructions to run on data can be found in the Procedure section of the manuscript.\
    By following the Procedure section, the users can reproduce the expected output data provided in the supplementary files.
