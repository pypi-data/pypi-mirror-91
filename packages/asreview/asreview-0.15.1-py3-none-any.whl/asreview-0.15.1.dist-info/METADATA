## ASReview: Active learning for Systematic Reviews

Systematic Reviews are “top of the bill” in research. The number of scientific studies is increasing exponentially in many scholarly fields. Performing a
sound systematic review is a time-consuming and sometimes boring task. Our
software is designed to accelerate the step of screening abstracts and titles
with a minimum of papers to be read by a human with no or very few false negatives.

The Active learning for Systematic Reviews (ASReview) project implements machine learning algorithms that interactively query the
researcher. This way of interactive machine learning is known as
[Active Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_learning_(machine_learning)).
ASReview offers support for classical learning algorithms and
state-of-the-art learning algorithms like neural networks.

ASReview software implements two different modes:

- **ASReview LAB**  This modus is used to perform a systematic review with
  interaction by the reviewer (the 'oracle' in literature on active learning).
  The software presents papers to the reviewer, whereafter the reviewer classifies them. See [ASReview LAB](https://github.com/asreview/asreview#asreview-lab).
- **Simulate**  The simulation modus is used to measure
  the performance of the active learning software on the results of fully labeled systematic
  reviews. To use the simulation mode, knowledge on programming and bash/Command Prompt
  is highly recommanded.

## Installation

The ASReview software requires Python 3.6+. Detailed
step-by-step instructions to install Python and ASReview are available for
[Windows](https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-windows/) and [macOS](https://asreview.nl/installation-guide-mac/) users. The project is available on [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/asreview/). Install the
project with (Windows users might have to use the prefix `python -m`):

```bash
pip install asreview
```

Upgrade ASReview with the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade asreview
```

## ASReview LAB

ASReview LAB is a user-friendly interface for screening documents and experimentation with AI-aided systematic reviews. Read more about using the software in the [Quick Tour](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lab/overview_lab.html).

## Covid-19 plugin

[![Covid-19 Plugin](https://github.com/asreview/asreview/blob/master/images/intro-covid19-small.png?raw=true)](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-covid19 "ASReview against COVID-19")

The ASReview team developed a plugin for researchers and doctors to facilitate the reading of literature on the Coronavirus. The [plugin](https://github.com/asreview/asreview-covid19) makes the [CORD-19](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research) dataset available in the ASReview software. A second database with studies published after December 1st 2019 is available as well (this dataset is more specific for publications on COVID-19).

Install the plugin with the command below.

```
pip install asreview-covid19
```

## Documentation

Documentation is available at [asreview.readthedocs.io/](https://asreview.readthedocs.io/). Please have a look at https://asreview.readthedocs.io/en/latest/lab/overview_lab.html for a quick tour through the user interface.
