.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
OpenTREP aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++ implementation, for parsing travel-focused requests (e\&.g\&., 'washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog')\&.
.PP
OpenTREP uses Xapian (http://www.xapian.org) for the Information Retrieval part, on freely available travel-related data (e\&.g\&., country names and codes, city names and codes, airline names and codes, etc\&.), mainly to be found in the OpenTravelData project (https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata): https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/opentraveldata
.PP
OpenTREP exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented, API\&. For instance, the static Parse() method takes, as input, a string containing the travel request, and yields, as output, the list of the recognised terms as well as their corresponding types\&. As an example, the travel request 'washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog' would give the following list: Origin airport: Washington, DC, USA Destination airport: Beijing, China Date of travel: next Monday Date of return: 1 week after next Monday Preferred airline: American Airlines; non-preferred airline: United Airlines Number of travellers: 2 adults and a dog
.PP
The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the corresponding travel or to visualise it on a map and calendar and to share it with others\&.
.PP
OpenTREP makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for increased functionality, speed and accuracy\&. In particular the Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used\&.
.PP
Note that OpenTREP currently only recognises points of reference (POR), as to be found in the ori_por_public\&.csv file: http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd/blob/trunk/refdata/ORI/ori_por_public.csv A good complementary tool is GeoBase (http://opentraveldata.github.io/geobases/), a Python-based software able to access to any travel-related data source\&.
