<b>Do not ask what OpenTrep can do for you. Ask what you can do for OpenTrep.</b>

You can help us to develop the OpenTrep library. There are always a lot
of things you can do:

- Start using OpenTrep
- Tell your friends about OpenTrep and help them to get started using it  
- If you find a bug, report it to us (on the <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/opentrep/newticket">dedicated
Sourceforge's Trac Web site</a>). Without your help we can never hope
to produce a bug free code.
- Help us to improve the documentation by providing information about
documentation bugs 
- Answer support requests in the OpenTrep <a
href="https://sourceforge.net/apps/phpbb/opentrep/">discussion
forums</a> on SourceForge. If you know the answer to a question, help
others to overcome their OpenTrep problems.
- Help us to improve our algorithms. If you know of a better way
(e.g., that is faster or requires less memory) to implement some of our
algorithms, then let us know.
- Help to port OpenTrep to new platforms. If you manage to compile
OpenTrep on a new platform, then tell how you did it.
- Send your code. If you have a good OpenTrep compatible code, which
you can release under the LGPL, and you think it should be included in
OpenTrep, then send it to the communauty.
- Become an OpenTrep developer. Send us (see the \ref authors page) an
e-mail and tell what you can do for OpenTrep.
