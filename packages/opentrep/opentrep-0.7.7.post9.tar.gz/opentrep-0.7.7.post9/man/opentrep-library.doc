	  C++ Travel Request Parsing (TREP) Library

\section sec_synopsis_config SYNOPSIS

\code
#include <opentrep/...>
\endcode

\section sec_description_config DESCRIPTION

OpenTREP aims at providing a clean API, and the corresponding C++
implementation, for parsing travel-focused requests (e.g.,
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog").

OpenTREP uses Xapian (http://www.xapian.org) for the Information Retrieval part,
on freely available travel-related data (e.g., country names and codes,
city names and codes, airline names and codes, etc.), mainly to be found
in the OpenTravelData project (https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata):
https://github.com/opentraveldata/opentraveldata/tree/master/opentraveldata

OpenTREP exposes a simple, clean and object-oriented, API. For instance,
the static Parse() method takes, as input, a string containing the travel
request, and yields, as output, the list of the recognised terms as well as
their corresponding types. As an example, the travel request
"washington dc beijing monday a/r +aa -ua 1 week 2 adults 1 dog" would give
the following list:
  * Origin airport: Washington, DC, USA
  * Destination airport: Beijing, China
  * Date of travel: next Monday
  * Date of return: 1 week after next Monday
  * Preferred airline: American Airlines; non-preferred airline: United Airlines
  * Number of travellers: 2 adults and a dog

The output can then be used by other systems, for instance to book the
corresponding travel or to visualise it on a map and calendar and to
share it with others.

OpenTREP makes an extensive use of existing open-source libraries for
increased functionality, speed and accuracy. In particular the
Boost (C++ Standard Extensions: http://www.boost.org) library is used.

Note that OpenTREP currently only recognises points of reference (POR),
as to be found in the ori_por_public.csv file:
http://github.com/opentraveldata/optd/blob/trunk/refdata/ORI/ori_por_public.csv
A good complementary tool is GeoBase (http://opentraveldata.github.io/geobases/),
a Python-based software able to access to any travel-related data source.
