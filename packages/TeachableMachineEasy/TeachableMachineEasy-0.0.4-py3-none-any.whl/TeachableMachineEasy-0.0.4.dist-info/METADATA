# Teachable Machine Easy Library
Many people know of Teachable Machine, by Google. This certain library/module only supports the image part of it. [Website where you can create it a h5 file/model.](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/train/image) Checklist:
✔️ h5 File Support, without user opening file themselves.
❌ Other Teachable Machine Options, like audio.
❌ Cross-platform testing.

Simple Syntax:
```python
from TeachableMachineEasy import main
main("keras_model.h5", messages=["You have Pepsi.", "You have Coke.", "You have Fanta.", "You have Red Bull."])
