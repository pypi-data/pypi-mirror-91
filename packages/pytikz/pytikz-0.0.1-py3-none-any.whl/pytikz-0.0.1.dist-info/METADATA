# Pytikz: generate pgf/tikz files with python

The purpose of this package is to facilitate the generation of pgf/tikz figures from within a python environment.
The objective of this package is to provide a unified pipeline for projecting geometrical shapes in any vector space onto the two-dimensional canvas.
Vectors and maps between vector spaces are at the core of this package; this package is much more than simply a collection of python wrappers for pgf/tikz commands.

To get started, have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/pglammers/pytikz/tree/master/examples/) or at the [source code](https://github.com/pglammers/pytikz/tree/master/pytikz).

While it is possible to draw graphs using geometrical shapes and text nodes, this is still a cumbersome operation.
Classes for facilitating graph generation may be added in a future version of this package.
