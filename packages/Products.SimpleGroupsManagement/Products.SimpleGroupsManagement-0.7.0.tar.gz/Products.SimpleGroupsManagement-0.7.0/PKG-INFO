Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        Have you ever feel the need to give to normal (AKA: not Manager/Site Administrator) Plone member the power to manage a group?
        
        Right now in Plone you can make this playing with the (**Plone Site Setup: Users and Groups**).
        Even playing with this permission is impossible to limit the group on which a member (or group) can manage.
        
        This product adds a minimal configuration, a member of the site (or all members in a group) **will be able to manage which users are part of a group**.
        
        You only need to go to the "*Groups management proxy settings*" settings panel.
        You need to insert a set of strings like...
        
        ::
        
            id1|group_id1
            id2|group_id2
            ...
        
        ...where *id1*, *id2* can be an user id or a group id.
        That mean: what is on the left can manage on group on the right.
        
        Members able to manage groups can also perform bulk upload of members by loading a simple text file.
        
        The utility also react to the **Add portal member** permission.
        If the current user has this permission he will be able to add blend new portal members to the group.
        
        When an user is added or removed, an event is notified.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Tested with Plone 5.2. Plone 4 should work too (untested).
        
        .. note::
           Right now we have **no migration** from old ( < 0.5) versions to version 0.5.
           You must manually copy/paste configuration from old portal_properties tool the new registry settings.
        
           If you want to provide ones: you are welcome!
        
        TODO
        ----
        
        The control panel integration user experience is a copy/paste from old ZMI portal_properties tool.
        I need a hero who can find time to fix it.
        
        Be aware!
        =========
        
        This products override all normal Plone permissions noted above! This can create **security black-holes** in your portal!

           :scale: 50
        
        The access to the new user/group management form is still protected by the *Use Simple Groups Management* permission (commonly given to all site Members).

        Changelog
        =========
        
        0.7.0 (2021-01-11)
        ------------------
        
        - Changes for Plone 5.2 and Python 3 compatibility.
          Plone 4 should work too, but untested.
          [keul]
        - The "Add new user" feature was not working on Plone 5.
          Now it's not based on standard Plone feature anymore due to changes in Plone 5:
          seems that "Add portal member" permission is not used, while the new "Plone Site Setup: Users and Groups" is too powerful.
        
          So: a new inline form for creating user is provided (very sloppy implementation, but the whole package is Plone 2.5 style, so...).
