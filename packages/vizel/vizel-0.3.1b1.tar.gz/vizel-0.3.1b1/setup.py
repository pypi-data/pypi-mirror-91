Other formats are\nnow supported as well, thanks to the help from the community.\n\n### Installing\n\nRun `pip install vizel`\n\nIf you get an error about missing graphviz when running the `graph-pdf`\ncommand, you might need to install it with\n\n` brew install graphviz` on OS X or\n\n`sudo apt-get install graphviz` on Ubuntu.\n\n## Usage\n\n`vizel` has the following commands:\n\n#### graph-pdf\n\n```\nvizel graph-pdf [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY\n\nGenerates a PDF displaying the graph created spanned by Zettel and their connections in the folder DIRECTORY.\n\nOptions:\n  --pdf-name TEXT  Name of the PDF file the graph is written into. Default:\n                   vizel_graph\n  --help  Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n#### stats\n\n```\n\nUsage: vizel stats [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY\n\n  Prints the stats of the graph spanned by Zettel in DIRECTORY.\n\n  Stats calculated:\n  - Number of Zettel\n  - Number of references between Zettel (including bi-directional and duplicate)\n  - Number of Zettel without any reference from or to a Zettel\n  - Number of connected components\n  \nOptions:\n  -q, --quiet  Quiet mode\n  --help       Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n##### A note on connected components\n\nThe fewer connected components your Zettelkasten has, the better. The\nideal number is 1. It means that you can reach any Zettel by following\nlinks. This, in turn, should increase the likelihood of making new\nsemantic connections.\n\nConnected components are a concept from graph theory. In the context of\na Zettelkasten and vizel, a connected component is a set of Zettel,\nwhich can be reached from any other Zettel in the same component by\nfollowing links. Those links do not need to be direct but can pass\nthrough other Zettel. The direction of the links also doesn't matter.\n\nTwo Zettel are not in the same component if there is no way to reach one\nfrom the other through links.\n\nConnected components will show up as separate clusters of Zettel when\nusing `graph-pdf`. Use the `components` command to get a list of your\ncomponents, and the Zettel contained in each.\n\n#### unconnected\n\n```\nUsage: vizel unconnected [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY\n\n  Prints all of the Zettel in DIRECTORY that have no in- or outgoing\n  references.\n\nOptions:\n  -q, --quiet  Quiet mode\n  --help       Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n#### components\n\n```\nUsage: vizel components [OPTIONS] DIRECTORY\n\n  Lists the connected components and their Zettel in DIRECTORY.\n\nOptions:\n  -q, --quiet  Quiet mode\n  --help       Show this message and exit.\n```\n\n## Built With\n\n* [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/): Network analysis in Python\n* [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com): Python composable\n  command-line interface toolkit\n* [Graphviz](https://github.com/xflr6/graphviz): Simple Python interface\n  for Graphviz\n\n## Updates & Contributing\n\nFeel free to open issues and pull-requests.
