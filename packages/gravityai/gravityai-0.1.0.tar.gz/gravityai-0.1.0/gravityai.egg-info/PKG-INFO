        This package includes helper scripts for interfacing your machine learning code with the Gravity-ai.com containerization code.
        
        To install from pypi:
        
        ```
        pip install gravityai
        ```
        
        To install from source:
        
        ```
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## Example Implementation Code
        
        ```
        from gravityai import gravityai as grav
        
        # the following function is a callback (defined by you), that may be
        # async or synchronous and that may be called multiple times, to
        # transform input data against an algorithm or model (or whatever you want)
        # If an error is experienced, return an error string message, or throw an exception.
        def process(dataPath, outPath):
            # TODO:
            # Read data in from dataPath
            # Transform Data via model
            # Write data out to outPath
            # Return None if everything went ok.
            # return an error string if there was a problem.
        
        
        # TODO Initialize models, etc. before calling wait_for_requests.
        
        grav.wait_for_requests(process)
        
        ```
        
        ## Building a new Version
        
        To build a new version for pypi (only we do that):
        
        ```
        python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
        
        python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
        
        python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
        
        python3 -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
        ```
