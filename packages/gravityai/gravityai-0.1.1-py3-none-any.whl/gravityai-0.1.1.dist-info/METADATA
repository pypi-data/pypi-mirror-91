# the following function is a callback (defined by you), that may be
# async or synchronous and that may be called multiple times, to
# transform input data against an algorithm or model (or whatever you want)
# If an error is experienced, return an error string message, or throw an exception.
def process(dataPath, outPath):
    # TODO:
    # Read data in from dataPath
    # Transform Data via model
    # Write data out to outPath
    # Return None if everything went ok.
    # return an error string if there was a problem.


# TODO Initialize models, etc. before calling wait_for_requests.

grav.wait_for_requests(process)
