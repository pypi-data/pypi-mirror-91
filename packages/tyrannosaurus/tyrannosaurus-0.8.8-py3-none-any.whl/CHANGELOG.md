# Changelog

Adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
and [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
After v1.0, will follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).


## [0.8.x] - 2021-01-08

### Changed
- Moved build to Python 3.9 (internal only)
- Bumped and simplified a few dependencies
- Moved pre-commit run commands in tox to after poetry install, so versions are enforced
- Replaced flake8-bandit with `bandit -r .` call (the former is abandoned)
- Made compatible with Github’s [master branch renaming](https://github.com/github/renaming)
  (Because this external change broke backwards compatibility for newly generated projects,
  I consider this a fix, which won’t trigger a minor version bump)

### Added
- A `--track` flag in `tyrannosaurus new` (to simplify the readme’s example)
- Some currently unused items in [tool.tyrannosaurus.sources]
- Integration with [https://github.com/pyupio/safety](Safety)
- A `--tyranno` flag to new (deprecates `--newest`, which is now hidden)
- `--version` and `--info` options (exit immediately)
- Support for Github packages (technically should trigger a minor version bump)
- Stub and shields for scrutinizer
- Source license headers
- Link to license in default readme

### Removed
- isort, which conflicted with black anyway
- trailing-whitespace hook, which was unnecessary due to black and prettifier,
  and which incorrectly modified markdown files

### Fixed
- Cleaned up code
- Bad editorconfig settings for yaml and json
- Improved readme and docs
- Wrote better descriptions and names of workflows
- Missing 'feature' and 'security' labels in pull request templates
- Added `.mypy_cache` to the trash list
- `ccybync` instead of `ccbync`
- incorrectly recognized license files
- Added `.git` to `.dockerignore`
- Added `*.tgz` and `!.npmignore` to `.gitignore`
