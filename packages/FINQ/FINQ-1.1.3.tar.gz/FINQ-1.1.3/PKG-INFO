Description: # FINQ
        Lightweight conveyor data processing python framework, which allows to quickly write long queries without a fear that it'll become unreadable, 
        because FINQ as opposed to standard library allows you to write each logical part of query at next line without tearing it and expanding logical block over whole function
        
        ## Start
        To start conveyor processing of your iterable you need to wrap it with `FINQ()` object which then allows you to call Basic methods
        
        ## Basic methods

        ## Constant functions
        These functions aren't intended to be called manually. Instead you have to pass them as an arguments to FINQ methods as mappings, reducers, predicates.
        Ordered Collection here is any collection which provides `__get_item__` based on index (Tuple, List)
