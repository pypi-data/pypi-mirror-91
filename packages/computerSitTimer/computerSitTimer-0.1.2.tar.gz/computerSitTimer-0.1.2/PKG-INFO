Description: # Computer Sit Timer
        This is a simple countdown timer that pops up 
        and stays on top to block the view until action is taken.
        It is similar to pomodoro technique,
        but started from different motivation:
        to not sit extensively in front of computer for better health.
        
        Several reasons why I re-invented the wheel instead of using existing (browser) apps:
        light-weight, blocking/really obtrusive, not browser extension/app 
        (as we all spend far too long on browsers), 
        runs in the notification tray (background) and not have a console/terminal there.
        
        Also, a hobby project for myself to try out developing desktop application with Python.
        Because I am lazy, I am now trying to use [`pySimpleGUI`]
        (more specifically `pySimpleGUIQt` for the tray)
        to do so.
        
        ## Setup and Installation
        As this package is uploaded to [PyPI], the easiest way to install is via pip:
        ```
        pip install computerSitTimer
        ```
        
        
        ## Resources:
         - [official Cookbook for pySimpleGUI](https://pysimplegui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cookbook/).
         - [trinket tutorials](https://pysimplegui.trinket.io/demo-programs#/demo-programs/multi-threaded-work)
           has quite something there (examples).
           It is basically like a VM and can run code and windows there.
