        # rcon
        An [RCON protocol](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_RCON_Protocol) client implementation.
        
        ## Requirements
        `rcon` requires Python 3.8 or higher.
        
        ## Documentation
        Documentation is available on [readthedocs](https://rcon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
        
        ## Installations
        
        Install rcon from the [AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/python-rcon/) or via:

        ## Quick start
        The `RCON` protocol is used to remotely control a game server, i.e. execute
        commands on a game server and receive the respective results.
        
        ```python
        from rcon import Client
        
        with Client('127.0.0.1', 5000, passwd='mysecretpassword') as client:
            response = client.run('some_command', 'with', 'some', 'arguments')
        
        print(response)
        ```
