# Extended Data Structures Package
## Uses
This is made to teach people about stacks, queues, linked lists, and oter data structures that are not openly there in Python 3.

# THIS IS ONLY MEANT FOR TEACHING AS THE PACKAGES MAY BE SLOW AND NOT FIT FOR LARGE PROJECTS. PYTHON 3 LISTS CONTAIN ALL OF THE FEATURES THAT ARE SHOWN IN THIS MODULE. THANK YOU.
