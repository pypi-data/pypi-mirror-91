Description: This application displays an icon in the system tray (also known as
        notification area) of your desktop, which shows the status of the JACK_ audio
        server and when you click on it, a menu pops up, which lets you quickly select
        from the JACK configuration presets you created with QjackCtl_. When you
        select a preset, its JACK engine and driver configuration settings are loaded
        via DBus into JACK and then the server is restarted. This allows you to switch
        between different audio setups with just two mouse clicks.
        
        **jack-select** works with the DBus-version of JACK only. It is written in
        Python 3 using the ``PyGObject`` bindings for GTK 3. Python 2 is not supported.
        
        It is available from the source code repository on GitHub:
