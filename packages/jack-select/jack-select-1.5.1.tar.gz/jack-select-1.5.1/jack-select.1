.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
jack\-select [\-h] [\-\-version] [\-\-a2j\-autostart] [\-\-a2j\-export\-hw] [\-a] [\-c PATH] [\-d] [\-i] [\-v] [preset]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
jack\-select displays an icon in the system tray (also known as notification
area) of your desktop, which shows the status of the JACK audio server and when
clicked, presents a pop\-up menu, where the user can select from a list of JACK
configuration presets created with \fBQjackCtl\fP\&.
.sp
When a preset is selected, the JACK configuration is changed according to the
settings of the preset via DBus and then the JACK server is restarted. This
allows the user to switch between different JACK audio setups with just two
mouse clicks.
.sp
When the mouse pointer hovers over the systray icon and JACK is running, a
tooltip will show the name of the active preset (if known), the most important
parameters of the current configuration and some JACK server statistics.
.sp
The entries in the "ALSA\-MIDI Bridge" sub\-menu allow to configure and start and
stop the \fIa2jmidi\fP service.
.sp
Lastly, there are menu entries to stop the JACK server and to quit the
application.
.SH STARTUP
.sp
jack\-select may be started from the command\-line, from the desktop start menu
or along with the user\(aqs desktop session, by putting the
\fBjack\-select.desktop\fP file into the user\(aqs autostart folder
(\fB<XDG_CONFIG_HOME>/autostart\fP).
.sp
When jack\-select starts up, it first checks whether there is already a running
instance of jack\-select. If so, when called with no command argument arguments,
it tells the existing jack\-select instance to open its menu.
.sp
If a preset name is passed as the first positional command\-line argument the
preset is activated immediately at application startup. If another instance of
jack\-select is already running, jack\-select will tell the existing instance to
activate the preset. An invalid preset name is silently ignored.
.SH PRESETS
.sp
jack\-select reads JACK configuration presets from QjackCtl\(aqs configuration file
(see \fBFILES\fP section). jack\-select does not create or change this file. It
parses the file on startup and then checks it at a regular interval. If the
file is created, changed or deleted, jack\-select will update its menu
accordingly.
.sp
To create or edit presets, the program \fBQjackCtl\fP can be used. Make the
desired changes in its configuration dialog and close it with "Ok" so the
changes are saved. The changes will be reflected in the jack\-select menu
immediately.
.sp
QjackCtl stores a nameless preset referred to with the label \fI(default)\fP in its
interface. Since there is no way to remove this preset from QjackCtl\(aqs
interface, jack\-select can optionally ignore this preset, unless it is the only
preset found in the configuration (see \fBOPTIONS\fP section).
.SH DEVICE DISCOVERY
.sp
jack\-select is able to detect the presence of ALSA devices and when they are
attached or removed. Menu entries for presets, which refer to ALSA devices
currently unavailable, will be deactivated. ALSA device discovery can be
disabled via a command line option (see \fBOPTIONS\fP section).
.SH ALSA-MIDI TO JACK BRIDGE
.sp
jack\-select provides a sub\-menu with entries to start and stop the a2jmidid
ALSA\-MIDI to JACK bridge via D\-BUS and set related options.
.sp
The bridge can be automatically started when activating a JACK preset and
you can select whether the bridge also exports hardware MIDI ports as JACK
MIDI ports.
.sp
The selected options are automatically stored in jack\-select\(aqs own settings
file and can also be overwritten via commadn line options.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
usage: jack\-select [\-h] [\-\-version] [\-a] [\-c PATH] [\-d] [\-i] [\-v] [preset]
.sp
A systray app to set the JACK configuration from QjackCtl presets via DBus.
