""" File extensions to MIME-Type  mapping

    All libzim *articles* contains the mime-type of their content, for the libzim
    reader to properly return it.

    Providing accurate mime-type for Zim Article is important to prevent broken features
    upon reading.
    Ex.: youtube scraper uses Web Assembly files (.wasm) for the WebM codecs.
    Without the proper mime-type, wasm files are returned as octet-stream and thus
    not loaded efficiently.

    Should your scraper need additional mapping, use mimetypes.add_type() and it will
    be automatically used. """
