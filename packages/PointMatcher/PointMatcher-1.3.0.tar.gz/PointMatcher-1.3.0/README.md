# PointMatcher

 PointMatcher is a graphical corresponding point annotation tool. In computer vision, normally we decide correspondences of points automatically by a feature point extraction algorithm (e.g. SIFT) and a feature matching algorithm (e.g. Brute Force). But when you want to do it manually, you can use this tool!

git clone https://github.com/daisatojp/PointMatcher.git --recursive
cd PointMatcher
python PointMatcher/__main__.py
```

## How to Use

Please read the [Tutorial](https://pointmatcher.readthedocs.io/en/master/Tutorial/Tutorial.html).

## Annotation format

```text
{
  "views": [
    {
      "id_view": 0,
      "filename": ["dirname", "dirname", ..., "filename"],
      "keypoints": [
        [x1, y1],
        [x2, y2],
        ...
      ]
    }
    ...
  ],
  "pairs": [
    {
      "id_view_i": 0,
      "id_view_j": 1,
      "matches": [
        [0, 0],
        [2, 3],
        ...
      ]
    }
    ...
