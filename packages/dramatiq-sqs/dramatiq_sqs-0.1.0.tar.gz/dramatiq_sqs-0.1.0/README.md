# dramatiq_sqs

A [Dramatiq] broker that can be used with [Amazon SQS].

This backend has a number of limitations compared to the built-in
Redis and RMQ backends:

* the max amount of time messages can be delayed by is 15 minutes,
* messages can be at most 256KiB large and
* messages must be processed within 2 hours of being pulled, otherwise
  they will be redelivered.

The backend uses [boto3] under the hood.  For details on how
authorization works, check out its [docs].
