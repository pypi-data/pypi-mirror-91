libtfr provides high-performance C and Python libraries for
calculating multitaper time-frequency reassignment (TFR) spectrograms
as well as conventional STFTs.  TFR spectrograms have enhanced
signal-to-noise characteristics and can provide very precise spectral
estimates under many conditions. The library requires FFTW for the underlying
FFT transformations.
