# Example configuration file for make_data_split.py

# --- Documentation for every config parameter that is available --- #
#
#    Main Parameters
#    ----------
#    n_files_train : int
#       Into how many files the training dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    n_files_validate : int
#       Into how many files the validation dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    n_files_rest : int
#       Into how many files the "rest" dataset should be split.
#       If you don't want to have this dataset, comment out the line or delete it!
#    output_file_folder : str
#       Path to the folder, where all the output .list files (and the bash job scripts) should be stored.
#    output_file_name : str
#       String, that specifies the prefix of the filename of the output .list files.
#       E.g. if = "xyzc_tight_0":
#       xyzc_tight_0_train_0.list, xyzc_tight_0_validate_0.list, ...
#    print_only : bool
#       If only informationa about the input_groups should be printed, and no .list files should be made.
#
#    Job submission Parameters
#    -------------------------
#    make_qsub_bash_files : bool
#       If bash files should be made, that can be submitted to a cluster, in order to actually concatenate
#       the files in the .list files.
#    submit_jobs : bool
#       Additionally to make_qsub_bash_files, submit the bash job scripts to the cluster after they have been made.
#       CAREFUL: May only work for Erlangen-CC.
#    venv_path : str
#       Path to a virtualenv, e.g. "/home/hpc/capn/mppi033h/.virtualenv/python_3_env/"
#    data_tools_folder : str
#       Dirpath, where the concatenate.py tool is located.
#       E.g. "/home/woody/capn/mppi033h/Code/OrcaNet/orcanet_contrib/data_tools"
#    chunksize : int
#       Chunksize parameter, that is used when calling concatenate.py
#    complib : str
#       Complib parameter, that is used when calling concatenate.py
#    complevel : int
#       Complevel parameter, that is used when calling concatenate.py
#    shuffle_delete : bool
#       Option for the shuffle_h5 tool, specifies if the input file that will be shuffled should be
#       deleted after the shuffling is finished.
#
#    Input Group Parameters
#    ----------------------
#    dir : str
#       Path of the directory, where the files for this input group are located.
#    run_ids_train/run_ids_validate/run_ids_rest : array
#       Array, which specifies the range of the run_ids, that should be used for the training/validation.rest
#       dataset of this input group.
#       E.g. if [1,5], the script will put files from this input group with run_ids from 1 to 5 (including 1 and 5)
#       to the training/validation/rest dataset.
#       If you don't want to use a specific dataset for this input group, comment out the line or delete it!
