    Cythereal MAGIC API

     The API for accessing Cythereal MAGIC products and services.  # API Clients  We provide clients in several languages for accessing the MAGIC API. https://bitbucket.org/cythereal/magic-clients  These clients are provided to make integration of the MAGIC API into your existing applications as easy as possible.  If you want to use a language that is not currently supported, please contact us at support@cythereal.com and we will be glad to help.  # Example Inputs  Here are some example inputs that can be used for testing the service:  * Binary SHA1: `ff9790d7902fea4c910b182f6e0b00221a40d616`   * Can be used for `file_hash` parameters. * Procedure RVA: `0x1000`   * Use with the above SHA1 for `proc_rva` parameters.   # API Conventions  Properties MUST be named using `snake_case`.  This API is inspired by the [google json style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml). Any questions about conventions not documented here should be addressed by this style guide.  **All responses** MUST be of type `APIResponse` and contain the following fields:  * `api_version` |  The current api version * `success` | Boolean value indicating if the operation succeeded. * `code` | Status code. Typically corresponds to the HTTP status code.  * `message` | A human readable message providing more details about the operation. Can be null or empty.  **Successful operations** MUST return a `SuccessResponse`, which extends `APIResponse` by adding:  * `data` | Properties containing the response object. * `success` | MUST equal True  When returning objects from a successful response, the `data` object SHOULD contain a property named after the requested object type. For example, the `/matches` endpoint should return a response object with `data.matches`. This property SHOULD  contain a list of the returned objects. For the `/matches` endpoint, the `data.matches` property contains a list of MagicMatch objects. See the `/matches` endpoint documentation for an example.  **Failed Operations** MUST return an `ErrorResponse`, which extends `APIResponse` by adding:  * `errors` | Array of error objects. An error object contains the following properties:     * `ErrorObject.reason` | Unique identifier for this error. Example: \"FileNotFoundError\".     * `ErrorObject.message`| Human readable error message. * `success` | MUST equal False.   # noqa: E501
