class VarianceBasedEarlyStopping(EarlyStopping):
    r"""
    .. deprecated:: 1.2
       Use :class:`EarlyStopping<EarlyStopping>` instead.

    Stop training once the model stops improving. This is a variation
    on the :class:`EarlyStopping<EarlyStopping>` class which takes the variance
    of the metric into account.

    The specific criterion for stopping is:

    .. math:: \left\vert\frac{M_{t-p} - M_t}{\sigma_{t-p}}\right\vert < \kappa

    where :math:`M_t` is the metric value at the current evaluation
    (time :math:`t`), :math:`p` is the "patience" parameter,
    :math:`\sigma_t` is the standard deviation of the metric, and
    :math:`\kappa` is the tolerance.

    This callback is called at the end of each epoch.

    :param period: Frequency with which the callback checks whether training
                   has converged (in epochs).
    :type period: int
    :param tolerance: The maximum (standardized) change required to consider
                      training as having converged.
    :type tolerance: float
    :param patience: How many intervals to wait before claiming the training
                     has converged.
    :type patience: int
    :param evaluator_callback: An instance of
        :class:`MetricEvaluator<MetricEvaluator>` or
        :class:`ObservableEvaluator<ObservableEvaluator>` which computes the
        metric/observable that we want to check for convergence.
    :type evaluator_callback: :class:`MetricEvaluator<MetricEvaluator>` or
                           :class:`ObservableEvaluator<ObservableEvaluator>`
    :param quantity_name: The name of the metric/observable stored in `evaluator_callback`.
    :type quantity_name: str
    :param variance_name: The name of the variance stored in `evaluator_callback`.
                          Ignored, exists for backward compatibility.
