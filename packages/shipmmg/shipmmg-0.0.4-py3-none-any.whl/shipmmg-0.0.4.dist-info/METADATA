## What is it?

**ShipMMG** is a unofficial Python package of ship maneuvering simulation with respect to the research committee on “standardization of mathematical model for ship maneuvering predictions” was organized by the JASNAOE.

## Where to get it
The source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: [https://github.com/ShipMMG/shipmmg](https://github.com/ShipMMG/shipmmg)

Binary installers for the latest released version will be available at the Python package index. Now, please install pDESy as following.

```sh
pip install shipmmg
# pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/ShipMMG/shipmmg.git # Install from GitHub
```
