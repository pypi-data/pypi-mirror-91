# PyPulseq: A Python Package for MRI Pulse Sequence Design

Pulse sequence design is a significant component of MRI research. However, multi-vendor studies require researchers to
be acquainted with each hardware platform's programming environment.

PyPulseq enables vendor-neutral pulse sequence design in Python [[1,2]](#references). The pulse sequences can be
exported as a `.seq` file to be run on  Siemens/[GE]/[Bruker] hardware by leveraging their respective
Pulseq interpreters. This tool is targeted at MRI pulse sequence designers, researchers, students and other interested
users. It is a translation of the Pulseq framework originally written in Matlab [[3]](#references). Currently, 
PyPulseq is compatible with Pulseq 1.2.0.

It is strongly recommended to first read the [Pulseq specification]  before proceeding. The specification
document defines the concepts required for pulse sequence design using PyPulseq. API docs can be found [here][api-docs].

## Installation
\>=Python 3.6, virtual environment recommended:

```pip install pypulseq```

## Lightning-start ‚ö° - PyPulseq in your browser!
1. Create a new notebook on [Google Colab][google-colab]
2. [Install][installation] PyPulseq
3. Get going!

Or, explore an example notebook:
1. Copy URL of an example notebook from [here][notebook-examples]
2. On [Google Colab][google-colab], insert the copied link to get started

## Quickstart üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇ - example scripts
Every example script creates a pulse sequence, plots the pulse timing diagram and writes a `.seq` file to disk.
1. [Install][installation] PyPulseq
2. Download and run any of the [example][script-examples] scripts.

## Deep dive ü§ø - custom pulse sequences
Getting started with pulse sequence design using `PyPulseq` is simple:
1. [Install][installation] PyPulseq
2. First, define system limits in `Opts` and then create a `Sequence` object with it:
    ```python
    from pypulseq.opts import Opts
    from pypulseq.sequence.sequence import Sequence

    system = Opts(max_grad=32, grad_unit='mT/m', max_slew=130, slew_unit='mT/m/s')
    seq = Sequence(system=system)
    ```
3. Then, design gradient, RF or ADC pulse sequence events:
    ```python
    from pypulseq.make_sinc_pulse import make_sinc_pulse
    from pypulseq.make_trap_pulse import make_trapezoid
    from pypulseq.make_adc import make_adc

    Nx, Ny = 256, 256 # matrix size
    fov = 220e-3 # field of view
    delta_k = fov / Nx

    # RF sinc pulse with a 90 degree flip angle
    rf90, _, _ = make_sinc_pulse(flip_angle=90, duration=2e-3, system=system, slice_thickness=5e-3, apodization=0.5,
       time_bw_product=4)

    # Frequency encode, trapezoidal event
    gx = make_trapezoid(channel='x', flat_area=Nx * delta_k, flat_time=6.4e-3, system=system)

    # ADC readout
    adc = make_adc(num_samples=Nx, duration=gx.flat_time, delay=gx.rise_time, system=system)
    ```
4. Add these pulse sequence events to the `Sequence` object from step 2. One or more events can be executed
simultaneously, simply pass them all to the `add_block()` method. For example, the `gx` and `adc` pulse sequence events
need to be executed simultaneously:
    ```python
    seq.add_block(rf90)
    seq.add_block(gx, adc)
    ```
5. Visualize plots:
    ```python
    seq.plot()
    ```
6. Generate a `.seq` file to be executed on a real MR scanner:
    ```python
    seq.write('demo.seq')
    ```

**Get in touch regarding running the `.seq` files on your Siemens/[GE]/[Bruker] scanner.**
