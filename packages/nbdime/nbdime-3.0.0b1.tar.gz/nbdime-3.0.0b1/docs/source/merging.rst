Merge details
=============

This sections provide details on how nbdime handles merges, and will mostly
be relevant for those who want to use nbdime as a library, or that want
to contribute to nbdime.

nbdime implements a three-way merge of Jupyter notebooks and a
subset of generic JSON objects.


Merge Results
-------------

A merge operation with a shared origin object ``base`` and modified
objects, ``local`` and ``remote``, outputs these merge results:

- a fully or partially merged object
- a set of :term:`merge decision` objects that describe the merge operation


Merge decision format
---------------------

Each three-way notebook merge is based on the differences between the ``base``
version and the two changed versions -- ``local`` and ``remote``. These
differences,``base`` with ``local`` and ``base`` with ``remote``, are then
compared, and for each change a set of decisions are
made. A :term:`merge decision` object represents such a decision, and is
represented as a dict with the following entries::

    {
        "local_diff": <diff object>,
        "remote_diff": <diff object>,
        "conflict": <boolean>,
        "action": <action taken/suggested>,
        "common_path": <JSON path>,
        "custom_diff": <diff object>
        "similar_insert: <diff object>
    }

Merge conflicts
***************

Merge conflicts are indicated with the ``conflict`` field on the decision
object, and if true, indicates that the given differences could not be
automatically reconciled.

.. note::

    Even when conflicted, the ``action`` field might indicate a suggested
    or "best guess" resolution of the decision. If no such suggestion
    can be inferred, the base value will be used as the default resolution.

Merge actions
*************

Each :term:`merge decision` has an entry ``action`` which describes the
resolution of the merge. It can take the following values:

    - **local**: Use the ``local`` changes, as described by ``local_diff``.
    - **remote**: Use the ``remote`` changes as described by ``remote_diff``.
    - **base**: Use the original value, that is, do not apply any
      changes.
    - **either**: Indicates that the ``local`` and ``remote`` changes are
      interchangeable, and that either can be used.
    - **local\_then\_remote** - First apply the ``local`` changes, then the
      ``remote`` changes. This is only applicable for certain subset of
      merges, like insertions in the same location (for example two
      cells added in the same location).
    - **remote\_then\_local** - Similar to **local\_then\_remote**, but
      ``remote`` changes are taken before ``local`` ones.
    - **clear** - Remove the value(s) on the object. Can, for example,
      be used to clear the outputs of a cell.
    - **custom** - Use the changes as described by ``custom_diff``.
      This can be used for more complex resolutions than those described
      by the other actions above. A simple example would be for the case
      of multiple cells (or alternatively, multiple lines of text)
      inserted both locally and remotely in the same location. Here, the
      correct resolution might be to take the first element from ``local``,
      then the ``remote`` changes, and finally the rest of the ``local`` changes.

Common path
***********

The ``common_path`` entry of a merge decision describes the path in which
the local and remote changes diverge. For example if the local changes
are specified as::

    patch "cells"
    ┗━┓ patch index 0
      ┣━┓ patch "source"
      ┃ ┗━ addrange <some lines of source to add>
      ┗━┓ patch "outputs"
        ┗━ addrange <a new output added>

and the remote changes are specified as::

    patch "cells"
    ┗━┓ patch index 0
      ┗━┓ patch "outputs"
        ┗━ removerange <all outputs removed>

then the common path will be ``["cells", 0]``, and the :term:`diff object`
will omit the ``patch "cells"`` and ``patch 0`` operations.
