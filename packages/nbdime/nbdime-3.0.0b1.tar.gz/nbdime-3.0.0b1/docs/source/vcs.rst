Version control integration
===========================

.. note::

    Currently only integration with git and mercurial is
    supported out of the box.

    Integration with other version control software
    should be possible if the version control software
    allows for external drivers and/or tools. For integration,
    follow the same patterns as outlined
    in the manual registration sections.



.. _git-integration:

Git integration
---------------

Git integration of nbdime is supported in two ways:

- through **drivers** for diff and merge operations, where
  nbdime takes on the responsibility for performing the
  diff/merge:

      * `Diff driver`_
      * `Merge driver`_

- through defining nbdime as diff and
  merge **tools**, which allow nbdime to display the
  diff/merge to the user without having to actually
  depend on git:

      * `Diff web tool`_
      * `Merge web tool`_

Configure git integration by editing the ``.gitconfig``
(or ``.git/config``) and ``.gitattributes`` in each
git repository or in the home/etc directory for global effect.
Details for how to individually configure the different
drivers/tools are given below.

To configure all diff/merge drivers and tools, simply call::

    nbdime config-git (--enable | --disable) [--global | --system]

This command will register nbdime with git for the current project
(repository), or on the global (user), or sytem level according to
the ``--global`` or ``--system`` options.

.. versionadded:: 0.3

    :command:`nbdime config-git`. Prior to 0.3, each nbdime entrypoint had to enable git integration separately.

.. note::
    When neither the global or system flag is given, the configuration
    is only applied to the current project (repository). The command
    will therefore need to be run from within a git repository.


Usage
*****
Once configured, the diff/merge drivers should simply work out of the
box. For example, the normal git diff command::

    git diff [<commit> [<commit>]] [--] [<path>…​]

should give you the standard diff for any non-notebook files, but
use nbdime's command-line diff for all ``.ipynb`` files. Nbdime
will also be used for all merges on notebook files (no specific
commands needed).

.. _diff web tool:

To launch the rich, web-based tools (for diff visualization and
merge conflict visualization/resolution), the following
commands will need to be executed::

    nbdiff-web [<commit> [<commit>]] [<path>]

See the `git diff documentation`_ for further explanation of
"<commit>" and "<path>" for this command.

.. figure:: images/nbdiff-web.png

   Figure: nbdime's content-aware diff

and::

.. figure:: images/nbmerge-web.png

   Figure: nbdime's merge with web-based GUI viewer

.. note::

    Using :command:`git-nbdiffdriver config` overrides the ability to call
    :command:`git difftool` with notebooks. Instead, call
    :command:`nbdiff-web` in the same way that you call :command:`git diff`,
    e.g. :command:`git diff [<commit> [<commit>]] [path]`.

.. note::

    If you simply call :command:`git mergetool --tool nbdime`, it will be 
    called for all merge conflicts, even on filetypes that it cannot
    handle. To only call on notebooks, add a filter on file paths, e.g.
    :command:`git mergetool --tool nbdime -- *.ipynb`.
    *This command has also been aliased as* :command:`nbdime mergetool`
    *for easy access*, and you can also add your own git alias for this
    command.


Diff driver
***********

Registering an external diff driver with git tells git
to call that application to calculate and display diffs
to the user. The driver will be called for commands such
as :command:`git diff`, but will not be used for all git commands
(e.g. :command:`git add --patch` will not use the driver).
Consult the git documentation for further details.

Registration can be done in two ways -- at the command line or manually.

Command line registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

nbdime supplies an entry point for registering its driver
with git::

    git-nbdiffdriver config --enable [--global | --system]

This command will register the nbdime diff driver with
git, and associate the diff driver with the ``.ipynb``
file extension. The ``--global | --system`` flags work as
explained above.

Manual registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, the diff driver can be registered manually
with the following steps:

- To register the driver with git under the name
  ``"jupyternotebook"``, add the following entries to the
  appropriate ``.gitconfig`` file
  (:command:`git config [--global | --system] -e` to edit)::

    [diff "jupyternotebook"]
    command = git-nbdiffdriver diff

  or if you prefer to use webdiff::
  
    [diff "jupyternotebook"]
    command = git-nbdiffdriver webdiff [--ip IP]

- To associate the diff driver with a file type,
  add the following entry to the appropriate
  ``.gitattributes`` file::

    *.ipynb diff=jupyternotebook


Merge driver
************

Registering an external merge driver with git tells git
to call that driver application to calculate merges of certain
files. This allows nbdime to become responsible for
merging all notebooks.

Registration can be done in two ways -- at the command line or manually.

Command line registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

nbdime supplies an entry point for registering its merge
driver with git::

    git-nbmergedriver config --enable [--global | --system]

This command will register the nbdime merge driver with
git, and associate the merge driver with the ``.ipynb``
file extension. The ``--global | --system`` flags work as
explained above.

Manual registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, the merge driver can be registered manually
with the following steps:

- To register the driver with git under the name
  "jupyternotebook", add the following entries to the appropriate
  ``.gitconfig`` file
  (:command:`git config [--global | --system] -e` to edit)::

    [merge "jupyternotebook"]
    command = git-nbmergedriver merge %O %A %B %L %P

- To associate the merge driver with a file type,
  add the following entry to the appropriate
  ``.gitattributes`` file::

    *.ipynb merge=jupyternotebook


Merge web tool
**************

The rich, web-based merge view can be installed as a git
*merge tool*. This enables nbdime to process merge conflicts
during merging in git, and present them for resolution.

Command line registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To register nbdime as a git merge tool, run the command::

    git-nbmergetool config --enable [--global | --system]

Once registered, the merge tool can be started by running
the git command::

    git mergetool --tool=nbdime [<file>…​]

If you want to avoid specifying the tool each time, nbdime
can be set as the default tool by adding the ``--set-default``
flag to the registration command::

    git-nbmergetool config --enable --set-default [--global | --system]

This will allow the merge tool to be launched simply by::

    git mergetool [<file>…​]

.. note::
    Git does not allow to select different tools per file type,
    so if you set nbdime as the default tool it will be called
    for *all merge conflicts*. This includes non-notebooks, which
    nbdime will fail to process. For most repositories, it will
    therefore not make sense to have nbdime as the default, but
    rather to call it selectively.


Manual registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Alternatively, the merge tool can be registered manually
with the following steps:

- To register both the merge tool with git under
  the name "nbdime", add the following entry
  to the appropriate ``.gitconfig`` file
  (:command:`git config [--global | --system] -e` to edit)::

    [mergetool "nbdime"]
    cmd = git-nbmergetool "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"

- To set nbdime as the default merge tool, add or modify
  the following entry in the appropriate ``.gitconfig`` file::

    [merge]
    tool = nbdime





.. _hg-integration:

Mercurial integration
---------------------

Integration of mercurial is similar to that for manual git
registration, but it uses a separate set of entry points since
amongst others, mercurial requires the diff extension to handle
directories.

Differs
*******

To tell mercurial about nbdimes differs, open the appropriate
config file (:command:`hg config --edit` for the default user level one),
and add the following entries::

    [extensions]
    extdiff =

    [extdiff]
    cmd.nbdiff = hg-nbdiff
    cmd.nbdiffweb = hg-nbdiffweb
    opts.nbdiffweb = --log-level ERROR

This will:
 - enable the external diff extension
 - register both the command line diff and web diff
 - set the default log level of the webdiff

``opts.<cmdname>`` allows you to customize which
flags nbdime are called with.

To use nbdime from mercurial, you can then call it like this::

    hg nbdiff <same arguments as for 'hg diff'>

    hg nbdiffweb <same arguments as for 'hg diff'>


Mergetools
**********

Add the following entries to the appropriate mercurial config
file::

    [merge-tools]
    nbdime.priority = 2
    nbdime.premerge = False
    nbdime.executable = hg-nbmerge
    nbdime.args = $base $local $other $output
    nbdimeweb.priority = 1
    nbdimeweb.premerge = False
    nbdimeweb.executable = hg-nbmergeweb
    nbdimeweb.args = --log-level ERROR $base $local $other $output
    nbdimeweb.gui = True

    [merge-patterns]
    **.ipynb = nbdime

This will:
 - use the merge driver by default for notebook files
 - register the web tool

The typical usage pattern for the webtool is like this::

    > hg merge <other branch>
    merging ***.ipynb
    0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 1 files unresolved
    use 'hg resolve' to retry unresolved file merges or 'hg update -C .' to abandon

    > hg resolve --tool nbdimeweb
