Parse [indicators of compromise](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/Indicators-of-Compromise-IOC) from text. You can test this project here: [http://ioc-finder.hightower.space/](http://ioc-finder.hightower.space/).

```python
from ioc_finder import find_iocs
text = "This is just an foobar.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
iocs = find_iocs(text)
print(iocs['domains'])  # ['foobar.com', 'example.org']
print(iocs['urls'])  # ['https://example.org/test/bingo.php']
```

## Capabilities

Currently, this package can the following items in a given text:

- Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) (in multiple formats such as `asn1234` and `as 1234`)
- Bitcoin addresses (P2PKH, P2SH, and Bech32)
- CIDR ranges (currently ipv4 ranges; ipv6 ranges coming soon)
- CVEs (e.g. `CVE-2014-1234`)
- Domain names (support for Unicode domain names (e.g. `È©xample.com`) is coming soon)
- Email addresses (both standard format (e.g. `test@example.com`) and an email with an IP address as the domain (e.g. `test@[192.168.0.1]`))
- File hashes (md5, sha1, sha256, sha512, and [import hashes](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html), and [authentihashes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463180.aspx))
- File paths (*beta*)
- Google Adsense Publisher IDs
- Google Analytics Tracker IDs
- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6)
- MAC addresses (*beta*)
- Monero (crypto-currency) addresses
- Phone numbers (*beta*)
- Registry key paths (e.g. `"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows`)
- SSDeep hashes (*beta*)
- URLs (URLs with and without schemes)
- User agents (*beta*)
- XMPP addresses (basically, this captures email addresses whose domain names contain "jabber" or "xmpp")
- MITRE ATT&CK data (see [more info](https://attack.mitre.org/)):
    - Pre-attack tactics and techniques (and [sub-techniques](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-subs-what-you-need-to-know-99bce414ae0b))
    - Enterprise mitigations, tactics, and techniques (and [sub-techniques](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-subs-what-you-need-to-know-99bce414ae0b))
    - Mobile mitigations, tactics, and techniques (and [sub-techniques](https://medium.com/mitre-attack/attack-subs-what-you-need-to-know-99bce414ae0b))
- [TLP labels](https://www.us-cert.gov/tlp)
- Others... if you have any requests, [let me know](https://github.com/fhightower/ioc-finder) (or you can contact me [here](https://hightower.space/contact/) to make private suggestions)!

Also provides some helpful features like:

- Option to parse domain name from a URL
- Option to parse domain name from an email address
- Option to parse IP address from a CIDR range
- Option to parse URLs without a scheme (e.g. without `https://`)
- Option to parse [import hashes](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html) and [authentihashes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463180.aspx)

## Known Limitations

- When parsing **registry key paths**, this library will NOT properly parse a registry key path where the last section contains a space. For example, `<HKCU>\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\advanced on` will be parsed as `<HKCU>\software\microsoft\windows\currentversion\explorer\advanced` (the space in the final section is removed).
- The items listed above (in the "Capabilities" section) that are postceded by "(*beta*)" are not very robust and may still have major issues. Any feedback or issues related to these items are much appreciated.
- When parsing **markdown**, if there is a domain name that is surrounded by underscores (which would make the domain name italic in some flavours of markdown - e.g. `_google.com_`), the domain will be parsed *including* the leading underscore (e.g. `_google.com_` would be parsed as `_google.com`).

## Python2 Support

All versions of the IOC Finder package *before* version 2.x are compatible with python2.7 . **Beware: version 1.x of the IOC Finder package is no longer maintained.** This means that any bug fixes or improvements will **not** be back-ported to previous versions.

To install a specific version of the IOC Finder package (or any other one) via pip, use the following formula:

```
pip install ioc-finder==<VERSION NUMBER>
```

For example:

```
pip install ioc-finder==1.2.18
```

## Installation

To install this package:

```
pip install ioc-finder
```

## Usage

This package can be used in [python](#python) or via a [command-line interface](#command-line-interface).

### Python

The primary function in this package is the `ioc_finder.find_iocs()` function. A simple usage looks like:

```python
from ioc_finder import find_iocs
text = "This is just an example.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
iocs = find_iocs(text)
print('Domains: {}'.format(iocs['domains']))
print('URLs: {}'.format(iocs['urls']))
```

#### Inputs

You must pass some text into the `find_iocs()` function as string (the iocs will be parsed from this text). You can also provide the options detailed below.

##### Options

The `find_iocs` takes the following keywords (all of them default to `True`):

- `parse_domain_from_url` (default=True): Whether or not to parse domain names from URLs (e.g. `example.com` from `https://example.com/test`)
- `parse_from_url_path` (default=True): Whether or not to parse observables from URL paths (e.g. `2f3ec0e4998909bb0efab13c82d30708ca9f88679e42b75ef13ea0466951d862` from `https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2f3ec0e4998909bb0efab13c82d30708ca9f88679e42b75ef13ea0466951d862/detection`)
- `parse_domain_from_email_address` (default=True): Whether or not to parse domain names from email addresses (e.g. `example.com` from `foo@example.com`)
- `parse_address_from_cidr` (default=True): Whether or not to parse IP addresses from CIDR ranges (e.g. `0.0.0.1` from `0.0.0.1/24`)
- `parse_urls_without_scheme` (default=True): Whether or not to parse URLs without a scheme (see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Generic_syntax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier#Generic_syntax)) (e.g. `hightower.space/projects`)
- `parse_imphashes` (default=True): Parse [import hashes](https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/01/tracking-malware-import-hashing.html) (which look like md5s, but are preceded by 'imphash' or 'import hash')
- `parse_authentihashes` (default=True): Parse [authentihashes](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/gg463180.aspx) (which look like sha256s, but are preceded with 'authentihash')

See [test_ioc_finder.py](https://github.com/fhightower/ioc-finder/blob/master/tests/test_ioc_finder.py) for more examples.

#### Output

The `find_iocs()` returns a dictionary in the following structure:

```json
{
    "asns": [],
    "attack_mitigations": {
        "enterprise": [],
        "mobile": []
    },

    "asns": [],
    "attack_mitigations": {
        "enterprise": [],
        "mobile": []
    },

    "tlp_labels": [],
    "urls": ["https://example.org/test/bingo.php"],
    "user_agents": [],
    "xmpp_addresses": []
}
```

##### Output Details

There are two grammars for email addresses. There is a fairly complete grammar to find email addresses matching the spec (which is very broad). Any of these complete email addresses (e.g. `foo"bar@gmail.com`) will be sent as output to in `email_addresses_complete` key.

Email addresses in the simple form we are familiar with (e.g. `bar@gmail.com`) will be sent as output in the `email_addresses` key.

### Command-Line Interface

The ioc-finder package can be used from a command line like:

```
ioc-finder "This is just an example.com https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
```

This will return:

```json
{
    "asns": [],
    "attack_mitigations": {
        "enterprise": [],
        "mobile": []
    },
    "attack_tactics": {
        "enterprise": [],
        "mobile": [],
        "pre_attack": []
    },
    "attack_techniques": {
        "enterprise": [],
        "mobile": [],
        "pre_attack": []
    },
    "authentihashes": [],
    "bitcoin_addresses": [],
    "cves": [],
    "domains": [
        "example.com",
        "example.org"
    ],
    "email_addresses": [],
    "email_addresses_complete": [],
    "file_paths": [],
    "google_adsense_publisher_ids": [],
    "google_analytics_tracker_ids": [],
    "imphashes": [],
    "ipv4_cidrs": [],
    "ipv4s": [],
    "ipv6s": [],
    "mac_addresses": [],
    "md5s": [],
    "monero_addresses": [],
    "phone_numbers": [],
    "registry_key_paths": [],
    "sha1s": [],
    "sha256s": [],
    "sha512s": [],
    "ssdeeps": [],
    "tlp_labels": [],
    "urls": [
        "https://example.org/test/bingo.php"
    ],
    "user_agents": [],
    "xmpp_addresses": []
}
```

Here are the usage instructions for the CLI:

```
Usage: ioc-finder [OPTIONS] TEXT

  CLI interface for parsing indicators of compromise.

Options:
  --no_url_domain_parsing         Using this flag will not parse domain names
                                  from URLs
  --no_email_addr_domain_parsing  Using this flag will not parse domain names
                                  from email addresses
  --no_cidr_address_parsing       Using this flag will not parse IP addresses
                                  from CIDR ranges
  --no_xmpp_addr_domain_parsing   Using this flag will not parse domain names
                                  from XMPP addresses
  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

### Parsing Specific Indicator Types

If you need to parse a specific indicator type, you can do this using one of the parse functions that start with `parse_`. For example, the code below will parse URLs:

```python
from ioc_finder import parse_urls
results = parse_urls('https://google.com')
print(results)
```

**Warning:** It is recommended that you use the `ioc_finder.find_iocs` function rather than a parse function as `ioc_finder.find_iocs` handles some of the nuances of parsing indicator data. If you use specific functions, the text you provide will **not** be [fanged](https://ioc-fang.hightower.space/) and may not return the data you expect.

## Credits

This project uses the [ioc_fanger](https://github.com/ioc-fang/ioc_fanger) package to make sure that all indicators in the text are properly [fanged](https://ioc-fang.hightower.space/).

This package was created with [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) and Floyd Hightower's [python-project-template](https://gitlab.com/fhightower-templates/python-project-template) project template.

Previous iterations of this package were inspired by [https://github.com/mosesschwartz/extract_iocs](https://github.com/mosesschwartz/extract_iocs).

### Other Helpful Projects

You may also be interested in [https://github.com/ioc-fang/ioc_fanger](https://github.com/ioc-fang/ioc_fanger), a project to fang and defang indicators of compromise. For example,

defanging:

```
example.com => example[.]com
https://example.com => hXXps://example[.]com
```

and fanging:

```
example[.]com => example.com
example(.)com => example.com
me AT example(.)com => me@example.com
```
