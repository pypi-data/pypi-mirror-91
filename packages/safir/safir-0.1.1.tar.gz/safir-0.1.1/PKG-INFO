Description: ############################################
        Safir is the SQuaRE Framework for Roundtable
        ############################################
        
        Roundtable_ is the SQuaRE application and bot deployment platform, hosted on Kubernetes with Argo CD.
        Safir is a Python package that lets you develop Roundtable bots, based on the `aiohttp.web`_ asyncio web framework.
        
        Install from PyPI:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
           pip install safir
        
        The best way to create a new Safir-based Roundtable bot is with the `roundtable_aiohttp_bot`_ template.
