def team_selection_using_linear_optimization(players_info, money_available):
    '''
    takes in a DataFrame containing all the players info that was read from the main fantasy premier league API,
    and all the calculated metrics that were added as columns. This function defines and solves a linear optimization problem
    to select the 15 players that would provide the best returns given the constraints of the game.

    Parameters:
        players_info (DataFrame): DataFrame containing all the players info that was read from the main fantasy premier league API,
                                    and all the calculated metrics that were added as columns
        money_available (float): the amount of money available to spend on players.This differs between players as team values go up and down
        
    Returns:
        list_of_selected_goalies (list): list containing the 2 selected goalies
        list_of_selected_defenders (list): list containing the 5 selected defender
        list_of_selected_midfielders (list): list containing the 5 selected midfielders
        list_of_selected_strikers (list): list containing the 3 selected strikers
        cash_left (float): the amount of cash left after selecting all the players
