# Viper
A modern testing framework.

## How to use it
Viper was made for people of all types and expertise.
To make a simple test, you can use the following code:
```python
from viper import Viper

snake = Viper("Example Tests")

def addition(a, b):
    return a + b

snake.test("check if addition function can solve 5 + 5", addition(5, 5), 10)

snake.evaluate()
```
On running this, you should get:
```markdown
This is Viper, a modern testing framework, created by Aarush Gupta (https://aarushgupta.tk)
Running tests for "Example Tests"
Testing "check if addition function can solve 5 + 5"... Passed

Ran 1 test(s) in 0.0004 seconds
1/1 passed
```
And if we change the 10 to become something else like so:
```python
snake.test("check if addition function can solve 5 + 5", addition(5, 5), 7)
```
The output becomes:
```markdown
This is Viper, a modern testing framework, created by Aarush Gupta (https://aarushgupta.tk)
Running tests for "Example Tests"
Testing "check if addition function can solve 5 + 5"... Failed
   Desired Output: "7" | Test Ouput: "10"

Ran 1 test(s) in 0.0006 seconds
0/1 passed
```
As one can see, the testing outputs are made so that it is simple, yet it is also informative
