Installation
============

User install
------------
To install simply run:
``pip install mpl_interactions``

The above only has Matplotlib as a dependency. If you plan on using ``mpl_interactions`` in a Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab then you should
install with ``pip install mpl_interactions[jupyter]``

Optional JupyterLab setup
-------------------------

If you plan on using mpl_interactions in notebooks with `JupyterLab <https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#>`_ then you need to ensure you have a fully working
installation of `ipympl <https://github.com/matplotlib/ipympl>`_. The ``ipympl`` python package is installed as a dependency; however, you
may need to take a few extra steps to get it to work in JupyterLab. In particular you need to make sure ``nodejs > 10`` is availiable
and that you have installed ``jupyterlab-manager``.


.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=13
   jupyter labextension install @jupyter-widgets/jupyterlab-manager
