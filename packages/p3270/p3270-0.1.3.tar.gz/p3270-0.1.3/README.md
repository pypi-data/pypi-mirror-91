## Description
A Python library that provides an interface to communicate with IBM hosts: send commands and text, receive output (screens). The library provides the means to do what a human can do using a 3270 emulator. 

The library is highly customizable and is built with simplicity in mind. 
It is written in Python 3, runs on Linux and Unix-like Operating Systems, and relies on the `s3270` utility. So it is required to have the `s3270` installed on your system and available on your PATH.

The library allows you to open a telnet connection to an IBM host, and execute a set of instructions as you specified them in your python program.


## Installation
A simple pip command brings the library to your environment: 

```pip install p3270```

__NB__: Make sure that you're using the python3 version of the pip command. 


## Usage 
Import the client class from the library:
```python 
from p3270 import P3270Client
```

Create a client object specifying a configuration file:
```python 
my_client = P3270Client(configFile='my-config.cfg')
```

It is also possible to create a client object with the config options stated in the code.
```python 
my_client = P3270Client(hostName='192.168.100.25', path='c:\\wc3270\\', codePage='cp277')
```

If the s3270 program is downloaded as a .zip file or otherwise fails to be added to the path when installed, it is possible to state the path when creating the P3270Client.

Connect the client, and you're good to go:
```python
if not my_client.connect():
    print('Connection failed !')
    exit(1)

# Start sending your commands to the host ...
```

### Configuration file:
The configuration file is used to set a bunch of parameters about the client and host interaction. The file has the following format:

```<parameter> = <value>```

Lines starting with a '#' are considered as comments and therefore ignored.
For now the parameters are:
- __hostname__: The name or IP address of the host to connect to. Default is `localhost`. 
- __port__: The port (on the host) to which the client should connect. Default is `23`.
- __model__: Terminal model name. The possible values are:
`3278-n` and `3279-n` (`n` is the model number and can take the value: 2, 3, 4 or 5). The _base model_ 3278 is a green on black 3270 display, whereas 3279 base model is a color 3270 display. _Model numbers_ are used to specify the screen definition (rows and columns) as follows:

Model number | Columns | Rows
---|---|---
2  |80 |24
3  |80 |32
4  |80 |43
5|132|27
Default is `3279-2`.

- __traceFile__: The file to which communication traces will be directed. If not set traces will not be generated.
- __LUName__: LU name to use for connection to the host. If it is not set, connection is done with no LU name. 
- __enableTLS__: Enable or not TLS connection to remote hosts(yes or np). Default is no. 
- __verifyCert__: Verify or not the certificate of the remote host (yes or no). Default is yes.
- __codePage__: The EBCDIC character set to use for communication with the host. 
Supported code pages depens on your `s3270` version. The list can be obtained by running the following command on your shell:
```sh 
# s3270 -v
```
Default is `cp037`.

An example of configuration file would be:
```sh
# Target hostname 
hostname = 192.168.100.25
# Port
port = 10023
# Model Name: Default 3279-2
model = 3279-2
# TraceFile
traceFile = client.trace
# LU name to use
#LUName = LUPY0001
# EBCDIC character set to use for the host
codePage = cp037
# The file where all the screens should be saved
screensDir = /home/me/projects/python/mainframe/screens/
```

One configuration file can be shared by multiple clients.

- `readTextAtPosition`, `readTextArea`, `getScreen` all return the text they read.



### Example:

```python
from p3270 import P3270Client

# Connect and test if connection succeeded or not
if not my_client.connect():
    print('Connection failed !')
    exit(1)

# Save the home screen to a file called 'home.html'. HTML format is the default.
my_client.saveScreen(fileName='home.html')

# Send user name to the current field (user ID)
my_client.sendText('user1')

# Send TAB key to go to the next field
my_client.sendTab()

# Send the user password to the password field.
my_client.sendText('password1')

# Send Enter key to submit the current screen with field contents
my_client.sendEnter()

# Clear the screen 
my_client.clearScreen()

# Send the CICS command 'CEMT INQ TASK' to get running tasks
my_client.sendText('CEMT INQ TASK')

# Submit 
my_client.sendEnter()

# Capture the screen
my_client.saveScreen(fileName='tasks.html')

# Go back : PF3 key
my_client.sendPF(3)

# Go back again
my_client.sendPF(3)

# Disconnect from the host 
my_client.disconnect()

# End the emulation session
my_client.endSession()
```


Screens should go to the directory specified in the parameter `screensDir` specified in the configuration file.
The library generates some log messages on the file p3270.log. You can adjust th elog level by modifying it directly on the library.
