Description: 
            A Python library that provides an interface to communicate with IBM hosts: send commands and text, receive output (screens). The library provides the means to do what a human can do using a 3270 emulator.
        
            The library is highly customizable and is built with simplicity in mind.
            It is written in Python 3, runs on Linux and Unix-like Operating Systems, and relies on the `s3270` utility. So it is required to have the `s3270` installed on your system and available on your PATH.
        
            The library allows you to open a telnet connection to an IBM host, and execute a set of instructions as you specified them in your python program.
