about
--
This is a python package for orbiting turtles in python's turtle package. all you need to use is the orbit function and it will move your turtle in an orbiting motion for as long as you loop it.
this package comes with 2 functions:

orbit function:
--
orbit(turt,originx,originy,radius,dangle,angle=0)

turt is the turtle to orbit

originx and originy is what its orbiting around. 

radius is how far from the origin the orbit it is

dangle is the delta angle, positive for counterclockwise, negetive for clockwise. the more the faster.

angle is the current angle. if you do not enter an angle, it will make an angle variable in your turtle (turtlename.angle) and will use that.

radians function
--
rad(x)

x is the number to convert to radians (from degrees).
