'''
agents module for reinforcement learning
========================================

This module provides different agents in reinforcement learning context.

Classes
-------
NoLearnAgent
    the base class of all agent classes

Agent
    the base class of all agent classes that learn from history

QLearning
    the Q-learning agent that can accept any learner

DeepQLearning
    the agent with neural network as a learner (derived from
    `QLearning` class)

RandomAgent
    an agent that randomly chooses an action

UserAgent
    an agent that shows current state and asks for user's choice
    of action

WarfarinAgent
    an agent based on Ravvaz et al (2016) paper for Warfarin Dosing

Types
-----
TrainingData
    a type alias for training data, consisting of a tuple of
    `ReilData` for X matrix and a tuple of floats for Y vector.

AgentType
    a type variable that is bound to `Agent`.
