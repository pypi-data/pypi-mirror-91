        Helper for AWS services like S3 written in python...
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
         â€¢	IAM user with read access to S3 and its secret keys<br>
         â€¢	AWS CLI configured with the secret keys<br>
         â€¢	Python, Pip<br>
        
        
        ### Getting Started
        
        Assuming that the [configuration of AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) using the corresponding secret keys of the IAM user, set up your environment using Python and virtualenv and install the library using pip once the virtual  environment is activated:
        
        `$ pip install py-aws-helper`
        
        ### Using s3objectfinder
        
        #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sample snippet:
        
        	from py_aws_helper import s3objectfinder
            
        	bucket=''     # provide bucket name
        	file_name=''    # provide file name
        	output = s3objectfinder.find_object(bucket=bucket, file_name=file_name)
        	print('Total objects fetched: ', output['total_objects_fetched'])
        	print('Total objects matched: ', output['total_objects_matched'])
        	print('Matched keys list: ', output['matched_keys'])
        
        #### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other arguments:
        
        The s3object finder module can take in two additional paramters other than the bucket and file_name namely , "prefix" and "delimiter" whose default values have been initiated as empty strings.
        
        The corresponding documentation for populating the "prefix" and "delimiter" arguments can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ListingKeysHierarchy.html)
