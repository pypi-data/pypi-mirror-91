        The ``scp`` plugin writes the report contents to local disk and then copies
        them to a remote host via ``scp``. This can be used to copy the report to a
        server's webroot or simply keep a backup around.

           Currently only the HTML format is supported.
        
        .. note::
        
           This plugin utilizes ``fabric`` for executing commands over SSH, which in
           turn utilizes ``paramiko``, which is licensed under LGPL 2.1. A copy of this
           license is included in ``LGPL-2.1.md`` in the plugin source.
