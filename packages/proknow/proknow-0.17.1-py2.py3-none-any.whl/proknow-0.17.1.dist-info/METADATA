# ProKnow DS - Python SDK

The ProKnow DS - Python SDK library provides convenient access to the ProKnow API from applications written in the Python language. It includes a pre-defined set of classes for API resources that initialize themselves dynamically from API responses.

## Documentation

Complete documentation is available on [Read the Docs](https://proknow-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Development

### Mac OSX

#### Initializing a Development Environment

1. Install the latest version of Python 3.8. This will be installed alongside the version that your operating system provides.
2. Run the following.
```
$ python3 -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
(env) $ pip install --upgrade pip
(env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
(env) $ pip install -e .
```

Deactivate your virtual environment with the `deactivate` command. As long as the environment is not removed, you may start sessions simply with the command `source env/bin/activate`.

**Note**: If you wish to update the requirements with new or updated packages, run the following.

```
(env) $ pip freeze --exclude-editable > requirements.txt
```

#### Testing

Before you start testing, you'll need access to a ProKnow DS organization where you can generate an [API token](https://support.proknow.com/article/165-configuring-your-profile#api-keys) for your project. Once you have your API token create a file called `pktestconfig.py` in the root of this project with the following contents:

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
base_url = "https://example.proknow.com"
credentials_id = "{{ id from credentials.json }}"
credentials_secret = "{{ secret from credentials.json }}"
```

Make sure to put your actual base_url and the id and secret from your `credentials.json` file in place of the placeholders above.

Next, run the tests with the `nox` command from within your virtual environment.

```
nox
```

To run a specific test using python 3, use the following form:

```
pytest tests/{{file name}}::{{test name}}
```

To run tests with the HTML coverage report, use the following:

```
pytest --cov=proknow --cov-branch --cov-report html tests
```

#### Building the Documentation

With the virtual environment, you can run `make clean && make html` to build the documentation.
```
cd docs/
make clean && make html
```

#### Packaging

First, make sure the version has been updated in setup.py. Then run the following.

```
rm -rf dist build */*.egg-info *.egg-info
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel --universal
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```
