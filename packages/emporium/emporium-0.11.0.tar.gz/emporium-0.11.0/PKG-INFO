        Introduction
        ------------
        
        Emporium provides an abstraction over file stores. It currently supports storing
        files on local disk, in memory, or on S3. Most stores are implemented as a
        simple wrapper around the `smart-open <https://pypi.org/project/smart-open/>`_
        package.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The following code snippet creates a store, writes some text to a file in the
        store, and then reads and prints the file twice. The file ``hello.txt`` will have
        been created under folder ``data/job``, relative to the current working directory.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           from emporium import create_store
        
           config = {
               "type": "local",
               "base_path": "data"
           }
        
           store = create_store(config)
        
           with store.write("job/hello.txt") as handle:
               handle.write("world!")
        
           with store.read("job/hello.txt") as handle:
               print(handle.read())
        
           substore = store.substore("job/")
        
           with substore.open("hello.txt") as handle:
               print(handle.read())
        
        To write the file to a key in S3, change the config definition to the following:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
           config = {
                "type": "s3",
                "bucket": "my-data-bucket",
                "prefix": "data"
           }
