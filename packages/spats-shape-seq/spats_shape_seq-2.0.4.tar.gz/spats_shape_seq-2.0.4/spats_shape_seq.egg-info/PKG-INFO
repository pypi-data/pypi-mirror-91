Description: 
        Spats processes reads and calculates SHAPE reactivities for SHAPE-Seq experiments on multiple RNAs. It accepts raw paired-end sequencing reads in fastq format, and a target sequence file containing the sequences of RNAs present in the experimental pool. Spats then performs read alignment to calculate distributions of read ends in the SHAPE (+) and (-) channel for each nucleotide in each RNA. Spats then estimates nucleotide resolution SHAPE reactivities for each RNA, using a model-driven maximum likelihood procedure based on a model of the reverse transcriptase process used in the SHAPE-Seq experiment.	Spats is a collaborative effort between the Aviran Lab at UC Davis, the Pachter Lab at UC Berkeley, the Trapnell Lab at the University of Washington, and the Lucks Lab at Northwestern University.
