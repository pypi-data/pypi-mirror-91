        ## Quick Start
        
        #### Requirements and Installation for Linux/Mac
        
        Note: AdaptNLP will be using the latest stable torch version (v1.7 as of 11/2/20) which requires Python 3.7+. Please downgrade torch<=1.6 if using Python 3.6
        
        ##### Virtual Environment
        To avoid dependency clustering and issues, it would be wise to install AdaptNLP in a virtual environment.
        To create a new python 3.7+ virtual environment, run this command and then activate it however your operating
        system specifies:
        
        ```
        python -m venv venv-adaptnlp
        ```
        
        ##### AdaptNLP Install
        Install using pip in your virtual environment:
        ```
        pip install adaptnlp
        ```
        
        If you want to work on AdaptNLP, `pip install adaptnlp[dev]` will install its development tools.
        
        #### Requirements and Installation for Windows
        
        ##### PyTorch Install
        PyTorch needs to be manually installed on Windows environments. If it's not already installed, proceed to http://pytorch.org/get-started/locally to select your preferences and then run the given install command. Note that the current version of PyTorch we use relies on cuda 10.1.
        
        ##### AdaptNLP Install
        Install using pip:
        ```
        pip install adaptnlp
        ```
        
        If you want to work on AdaptNLP, `pip install adaptnlp[dev]` will install its development tools.
        
        #### Examples and General Use
        
        Once you have installed AdaptNLP, here are a few examples of what you can run with AdaptNLP modules:
        
        ##### Named Entity Recognition with `EasyTokenTagger`
        
        ```python
        from adaptnlp import EasyTokenTagger
        
        ## Example Text
        example_text = "Novetta's headquarters is located in Mclean, Virginia."
        
        ## Load the token tagger module and tag text with the NER model 
        tagger = EasyTokenTagger()
        sentences = tagger.tag_text(text=example_text, model_name_or_path="ner")
        
        ## Output tagged token span results in Flair's Sentence object model
        for sentence in sentences:
            for entity in sentence.get_spans("ner"):
                print(entity)
        
        ```
        
        ##### English Sentiment Classifier `EasySequenceClassifier`
        
        ```python
        from adaptnlp import EasySequenceClassifier 
        from pprint import pprint
        
        ## Example Text
        example_text = "This didn't work at all"
        
        ## Load the sequence classifier module and classify sequence of text with the multi-lingual sentiment model 
        classifier = EasySequenceClassifier()
        sentences = classifier.tag_text(
            text=example_text,
            model_name_or_path="nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment",
            mini_batch_size=1,
        )
        
        ## Output labeled text results in Flair's Sentence object model
        print("Tag Score Outputs:\n")
        for sentence in sentences:
            pprint({sentence.to_original_text(): sentence.labels})
        
        ```
        
        ##### Span-based Question Answering `EasyQuestionAnswering`
        
        ```python
        from adaptnlp import EasyQuestionAnswering 
        from pprint import pprint
        
        ## Example Query and Context 
        query = "What is the meaning of life?"
        context = "Machine Learning is the meaning of life."
        top_n = 5
        
        ## Load the QA module and run inference on results 
        qa = EasyQuestionAnswering()
        best_answer, best_n_answers = qa.predict_qa(query=query, context=context, n_best_size=top_n, mini_batch_size=1, model_name_or_path="distilbert-base-uncased-distilled-squad")
        
        ## Output top answer as well as top 5 answers
        print(best_answer)
        pprint(best_n_answers)
        ```
        
        ##### Summarization `EasySummarizer`
        
        ```python
        from adaptnlp import EasySummarizer
        
        # Text from encyclopedia Britannica on Einstein
        text = """Einstein would write that two “wonders” deeply affected his early years. The first was his encounter with a compass at age five. 
                  He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle. This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces. 
                  The second wonder came at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured, calling it his 'sacred little geometry 
                  book'. Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and chanting religious songs on 
                  the way to school. This began to change, however, after he read science books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This challenge 
                  to established authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium, Einstein often felt out of place and victimized 
                  by a Prussian-style educational system that seemed to stifle originality and creativity. One teacher even told him that he would 
                  never amount to anything."""
        
        summarizer = EasySummarizer()
        
        # Summarize
        summaries = summarizer.summarize(text = text, model_name_or_path="t5-small", mini_batch_size=1, num_beams = 4, min_length=0, max_length=100, early_stopping=True)
        
        print("Summaries:\n")
        for s in summaries:
            print(s, "\n")
        ```
        
        ##### Translation `EasyTranslator`
        ```python
        from adaptnlp import EasyTranslator
        
        text = ["Machine learning will take over the world very soon.",
                "Machines can speak in many languages.",]
        
        translator = EasyTranslator()
        
        # Translate
        translations = translator.translate(text = text, t5_prefix="translate English to German", model_name_or_path="t5-small", mini_batch_size=1, min_length=0, max_length=100, early_stopping=True)
        
        print("Translations:\n")
        for t in translations:
            print(t, "\n")
        ```

        ## REST Service 
        
        We use FastAPI for standing up endpoints for serving state-of-the-art NLP models with AdaptNLP.
        
        ![Swagger Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/novetta/adaptnlp/master/docs/img/fastapi-docs.png)
        
        The [REST](https://github.com/Novetta/adaptnlp/tree/master/rest) directory contains more detail on deploying a REST API locally or with docker in a very easy and
        fast way.
          
        ## Docker
        
        AdaptNLP official docker images are up on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/achangnovetta/adaptnlp).
        
        Images have AdaptNLP installed from source in developer mode with tutorial notebooks available, and will default to launching a jupyter server from where you can start 
        running the tutorial and workshop notebooks.
        
        Images can build with GPU support if NVIDA-Docker is correctly installed.
        
        #### Pull and Run AdaptNLP Immediately
        Simply run an image with AdaptNLP installed from source in developer mode by running:
        ```
        docker run -itp 8888:8888 achangnovetta/adaptnlp:latest
        ```
        Run an image with AdaptNLP running on GPUs if you have nvidia drivers and nvidia-docker 19.03+ installed:
        ```
        docker run -itp 8888:8888 --gpus all achangnovetta/adaptnlp:latest
        ```
        
        Check `localhost:8888` or `localhost:8888/lab` to access the container notebook servers.
        
        
        #### Build
        
        Refer to the `docker/` directory and run the following to build and run adaptnlp from the available images.
        
        Note: A container with GPUs enabled requires Docker version 19.03+ and nvida-docker installed
        ```
        # From the repo directory
        docker build -t achangnovetta/adaptnlp:latest -f docker/runtime/Dockerfile.cuda11.0-runtime-ubuntu18.04-py3.8 .
        docker run -itp 8888:8888 achangnovetta/adaptnlp:latest
        ```
        If you want to use CUDA compatible GPUs 
        ```
        docker run -itp 8888:8888 --gpus all achangnovetta/adaptnlp:latest
        ```
        
        Check `localhost:8888` or `localhost:8888/lab` to access the container notebook servers.
