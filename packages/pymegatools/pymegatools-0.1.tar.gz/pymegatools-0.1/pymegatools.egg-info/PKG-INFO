Description: # PyMegatools - A WIP Python Wrapper for [megatools](https://megatools.megous.com/)
        
        This is a WIP Python Library for the [megatools](https://megatools.megous.com/) command line utility 
        
        As of right now, you can use this library to download files from mega.nz
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You can either install it from PyPi
        ```shell
        pip install pymegatools
        ```
        
        or traditionally with [setup.py](setup.py)
        ```shell
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        ## A quick example
        
        This example shows how to use this wrapper to download any file from mega.nz
        
        ```python
        from pymegatools import Megatools
        
        # Initialization
        # By default the linux x86_64 binary is loaded
        mega = Megatools()
        
        # Or you can get the official megatools static binaries for your platform at https://megatools.megous.com/builds/experimental/
        # And load it like this:
        mega = Megatools(executable="path/to/megatools")
        
        # Downloading a file from url
        url = 'https://mega.nz/file/PpVB0CTZ#bwa51HbeKaVjuCff_lzbH4nQnV27uBxmcF89PnnACvY'
        output = mega.download(url)
        print(output)
        ```
