v4.0.0a3 (2021-01-13)
---------------------

Features - 4.0.0a3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Raise exception when set env enters into a circular reference - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1779 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1779>`_)
- - Raise exception when variable substitution enters into a circle.
  - Add ``{/}`` as substitution for os specific path separator.
  - Add ``{env_bin_dir}`` constant substitution.
  - Implement support for ``--discover`` flag - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1784 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1784>`_)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Entries in the ``set_env`` does not reference environments from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1776 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1776>`_)
- ``env`` substitution does not uses values from ``set_env`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1779 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1779>`_)
- Adopt tox 3 base pass env list, by adding:

  - on all platforms: ``LANG``, ``LANGUAGE``, ``CURL_CA_BUNDLE``, ``SSL_CERT_FILE`` , ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``REQUESTS_CA_BUNLDE``,
  - on Windows: ``SYSTEMDRIVE`` - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1780 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1780>`_)
- Fixed a bug that crashed tox where calling tox with the recreate flag and when multiple environments were reusing the
  same package - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1782 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1782>`_)
- - Python version markers are stripped in package dependencies (after wrongfully being detected as an extra marker).
  - In packaging APIs do not set ``PYTHONPATH`` (to empty string) if ``backend-path`` is empty.
  - Fix commands parsing on Windows (do not auto-escape ``\`` - instead users should use the new ``{\}``, and on parsed
    arguments strip both ``'`` and ``"`` quoted outcomes).
  - Allow windows paths in substitution set/default (the ``:`` character used to separate substitution arguments may
    also be present in paths on Windows - do not support single capital letter values as substitution arguments) -
    by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1784 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1784>`_)
- Rework how we handle python packaging environments:

  - the base packaging environment changed from ``.package`` to ``.pkg``,
  - merged the ``sdist``, ``wheel`` and ``dev`` separate packaging implementations into one, and internally dynamically
    pick the one that's needed,
  - the base packaging environment always uses the same python environment as tox is installed into,
  - the base packaging environment is used to get the metadata of the project (via PEP-517) and to build ``sdist`` and
    ``dev`` packages,
  - for building wheels introduced a new per env configurable option ``wheel_build_env``, if the target python major/minor
    and implementation for the run tox environment and the base package tox environment matches set this to ``.pkg``,
    otherwise this is ``.pkg-{implementation}{major}{minor}``,
  - internally now packaging environments can create further packaging environments they are responsible of managing,
  - updated ``depends`` to use the packaging logic,
  - add support skip missing interpreters for depends and show config,

  by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1804 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1804>`_)


v4.0.0a2 (2021-01-09)
---------------------

  :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1630 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1630>`_)

Bugfixes - 4.0.0a2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Fix coverage generation in CI - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1551 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1551>`_)
- Fix the CI failures:

  - drop Python 3.5 support as it's not expected to get to a release before EOL,
  - fix test using ``\n`` instead of ``os.linesep``,
  - Windows Python 3.6 does not contain ``_overlapped.ReadFileInto``

  - by :user:`gaborbernat`. (`#1556 <https://github.com/tox-dev/tox/issues/1556>`_)

Improved Documentation - 4.0.0a2

v4.0.0a1
--------
* First version all is brand new.

.. warning::

   The current tox is the second iteration of implementation. From version ``0.5`` all the way to ``3.X``
   we numbered the first iteration. Version ``4.0.0a1`` is a complete rewrite of the package, and as such this release
   history starts from there. The old changelog is still available in the
   `legacy branch documentation <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/legacy/changelog.html>`_.
