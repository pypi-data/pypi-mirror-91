        ## Details
        
        ### Windows
        The program simply calls the [SetThreadExecutionState](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-setthreadexecutionstate?redirectedfrom=MSDN) with the `ES_SYSTEM_REQUIRED` flag, when setting the keepawake, and removes flag when unsetting. The flag cannot prevent sleeping if
        - User closes the lid of their laptop
        - User presses power button
        - User selects *Sleep* from the Start menu.
