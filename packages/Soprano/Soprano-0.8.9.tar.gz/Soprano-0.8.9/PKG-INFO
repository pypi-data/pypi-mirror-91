Description: 
        Soprano is a Python library developed and maintained by the CCP for NMR
        Crystallography as a tool to help scientists working with crystallography and
        simulations to generate, manipulate, run calculations on and analyse large
        data sets of crystal structures, with a particular attention to the output of
        ab-initio random structure searching,
        or AIRSS. (https://www.mtg.msm.cam.ac.uk/Codes/AIRSS)
        
        It provides a number of functionalities to help automate many common tasks
        in computational crystallography.
