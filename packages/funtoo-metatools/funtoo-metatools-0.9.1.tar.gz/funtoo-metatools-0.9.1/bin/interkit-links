# This command takes two arguments, a kit and a branch.
#
# It will query the deepdive database, and identify all catpkgs referenced by the specified
# kit/branch that do not exist within the kit -- in other words, the outbound 'inter-kit
# links.' These catpkgs exist in other kits -- or may not exist at all. Anything printed
# simply refers to things referenced in the kit that can't be found within the kit.
