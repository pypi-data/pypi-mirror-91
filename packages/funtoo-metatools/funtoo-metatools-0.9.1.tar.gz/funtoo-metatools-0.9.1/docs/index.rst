Welcome to Funtoo Metatools
===========================

Funtoo metatools is a framework of powerful technologies created by Daniel
Robbins, the creator of Gentoo Linux, which allows you to create and maintain an
advanced Gentoo-based Linux distribution.

Funtoo Linux uses ``metatools`` extensively to perform all its automated
functionality, including auto-creation of ebuilds, auto-creation of "kits" and
"meta-repo" from upstream repositories or locally-forked packages, CDN mirroring of distfiles (source code artifacts) and advanced
analytics. Basically, it does 'all the things' related to creating and
maintaining Funtoo Linux.

You can use ``metatools`` as part of your own distribution infrastructure, or
leverage it as you contribute to Funtoo Linux.

See :ref:`What is Metatools?` for more
details on what is and what it can do for you. Learn more about the pluggable
technology upon which ``metatools`` is based by reading :ref:`POP Framework`.

Why is this Free?
=================

This technology, which contains essentially all the technology that
comprises Funtoo Linux, is being released under an Open Source license (`Apache Software License, version 2`) along with
easy-to-understand documentation, based on the belief that software should be
free to use and modify, and easy to understand, use and extend. I want this technology
to not just be 'Open Source' but be 'open' in the sense that it can be used, understood
and enjoyed by others.

Beyond the License
==================

Open Source is more than a license. Free software is more than just source code.
It is a philosophy of developing software that benefits greatly from true
collaboration and openness. Qualities such as honesty, integrity, transparency
of intent, not pursuing your own ambition in a way that is harmful to others or
their endeavors, and a sincere desire to help and give back are the attributes
that form the foundation of Open Source and Free Software. These qualities
result in people from around the world working together, and ultimately sharing
source code.

Said another way -- You can use this software, and even abide by its licensing terms,
and still potentially undermine the pillars of true
collaboration.

I created Gentoo Linux and now Funtoo Linux with the to collaborate with you,
and to have fun by working together towards common interests. I ask that you
consider your own ethical commitment not just to the license, but to the
projects that you choose to use, participate in and support.

I will defend your right to fork, or simply take this code and do your own thing
without giving anything in return,
because the source code license allows you to
do that. But choosing to spurn collaboration with upstream projects can be a frivolous
exercise which negatively impacts the collaborative ecosystem that sustains
Open Source and free software. We should all be trying our best not just to
use free software, nor merely benefit personally from it, but to work
together in the spirit of Open Source, as much as we are able.

At its heart, Open Source is more than a license or source code. It is a shared code *of ethics* which governs our
behavior and guides our actions towards one another:

  |  **NOW this is the Law of the Jungle — as old and as true as the sky;**
  |  **And the Wolf that shall keep it may prosper, but the Wolf that shall break it must die.**
  |
  |  **As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back —**
  |  **For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.**
  |
  |  ― `Rudyard Kipling, The Jungle Book`_

We should all be seeking to strengthen our "pack". This is the true meaning of
collaboration, which is the heart of Open Source and free software.
