Auto-generation
===============

``metatools`` includes the ``doit`` command, which implements "auto-generation"
of ebuilds. But what exactly is "auto-generation"?

In its broadest sense, "auto-generation" is the high-level creation of ebuilds.
This can involve any number of advanced capabilities,
such as querying GitHub_ or GitLab_ to find the latest version of a package,
actually fetching source code and looking inside it, or using Jinja_ to generate
ebuilds using templates. Typically, multiple approaches are used together.

We use these capabilities to *reduce the manual labor required to
maintain packages*. These capabilities
exist to give us *leverage* over the complex world of software so that we
can automate as much as possible, so we can do more with less.

Running Auto-Generation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To actually use these tools to auto-generate ebuilds, it is recommended that you
check out the `kit-fixups`_ repository, which is the master repository of Funtoo
Linux. This repository is organized into directories for each kit, and sub-directories
for each kit version, with ``current`` often used as a sub-directory name for kit
version. So, for example, if we wanted to auto-generate all ebuilds in
``core-kit/current``, we would do this::

  $ cd development
  $ git clone https://code.funtoo.org/bitbucket/scm/core/kit-fixups.git
  $ cd kit-fixups/core-kit/curated
  $ doit

In the above example, it will see that the directory ``kit-fixups/core-kit/curated``
is an overlay that contains categories, and it will look inside it for all "autogens"
and execute them.

When ``doit`` runs, it will determine its context by looking at the current working
directory, similar to how the ``git`` command will find what git repository it is in by looking
backwards from the current working directory. It will then fire off auto-generation in
the current directory, looking in the current directory *and any sub-directories* for all
autogens, and will execute them. You will see a lot of ``....`` being printed on the screen, which means
that files are being downloaded. What is actually happening is that ``doit`` is querying
Web APIs like GitHub and GitLab to find the latest versions of packages, and then downloading
the source code tarballs (in ``metatools`` vernacular: "artifacts") for these packages, and a
period is printed for each block of data received to show progress. Often times, multiple
artifacts are being downloaded at the same time.
Then, as the artifacts are received, ``doit`` creates ebuilds for these packages, and also creates ``Manifest`` files referencing
the SHA512 and other digests of the downloaded Artifacts. You end up with ebuilds that you
can test out by running ``ebuild foo-1.0.ebuild clean merge``.

Where are these "autogens"? They are ``autogen.py`` files that exist in the repository. Think of our autogens as plug-ins, written in Python and leveraging the
:ref:`POP Framework`, that contain
a ``generate()`` function which can generate one or more ebuilds using the ``metatools``
API. The ``metatools`` API, which we'll look at in a bit, is an extensible API that lets us query Web APIs, use
Jinja and perform other neat tricks to generate ebuilds.

In addition to raw autogens, there are also ``autogen.yaml`` files which allow for creation of
ebuilds *en masse*. In the YAML, you specify an autogen (also called a metatools "generator") plus packages and
package-specific metadata to feed to that generator. When you feed package data to a generator, it
spits out ebuilds. This is both highly efficient (it's fast) and also a nice way to generate
ebuilds with little or no redundant code. ``metatools`` contains a number of built-in generators
that can be used with the YAML system, such as generators that build ebuilds for Python packages on PyPi.

Go ahead and poke around inside `kit-fixups`_ and look at the ``autogen.py`` and
``autogen.yaml`` files. You'll begin to get a sense for what they look like and and inkling of how everything
works.

Also type ``git status``. You should see that a bunch of ebuilds (along with ``Manifest`` files)
were created. These files are *not* added to git. They simply sit in your local repo, and you can
blow them away by running::

  $ git clean -fd

When doing developent, we actually *do not* want to commit the auto-generated ebuilds themselves to
`kit-fixups`_ --
we just want to commit the autogens (``autogen.py`` and ``autogen.yaml``.) There is a separate
step, peformed by the ``merge-kits`` command, which updates the meta-repo and will
commit the generated ebuilds to kits which are then pushed out to users. But for ``kit-fixups``,
we're doing development, not updating the tree, so we just want to commit the autogens.
