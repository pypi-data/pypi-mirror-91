"""

We use MongoDB to cache HTTP requests for standard REST and other live data. We also use it to record stats for
artifacts (SRC_URI files) we have downloaded. This is handy for identifying downloads that have failed for some
reason. However, Artifacts don't get cached in MongoDB but are instead written to disk. But we do cache metadata
of the downloaded artifact -- its message digests and size at the time the download was done. This allows us to

1) detect when one of the archives was modified on disk; and
2) regenerate ebuilds even if we don't have archives available (feature not yet implemented, but possible)
