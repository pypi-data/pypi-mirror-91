    This is taken from the function count_reads_in_features() from the 
    script htseq-count in the HTSeq package version 0.70 
    The reason to do so is to fix two really small bugs related to the SAM output.
    The code of the function is small and simple so for now we
    will use the patched function here. A patch request has been sent
    to the HTSeq team.
    The description of the parameters are the same as htseq-count.
    Two parameters were added to filter out what to write in the sam output
