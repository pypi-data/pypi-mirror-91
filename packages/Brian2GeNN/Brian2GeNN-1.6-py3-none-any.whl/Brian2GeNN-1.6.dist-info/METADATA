Brian2GeNN is an interface between Brian 2 and GeNN. Brian2 is a simulator for spiking neural networks available on a variety of platforms. It is the successor of Brian1 and shares its approach of being highly flexible and easily extensible. It is based on a code generation framework that allows to execute simulations using other programming languages and/or on different
devices. 

GeNN (GPU enhanced Neuronal Networksm, https://github.com/genn-team/genn) is a framework that uses code generation methods to allow using GPU accelerators without in-depth knowledge of the CUDA programming interface.

Brian2Genn provides an interface to use GeNN as a backend device in Brian2. This allows users to run their Brian 2 scripts on NVIDIA GPU accelerators without any further necessary programming.

We currently consider this software to be in the beta status, please report
issues to the github issue tracker (https://github.com/brian-team/brian2genn/issues).
