Auto Name:Fake OTA Update
Summary:Tests whether OTA ZIP files are being include
Description:
F-Droid can make use of system privileges or permissions to
install, update and remove applications on its own. The only way to obtain those
privileges is to become a system app.

This is where the Privileged Extension comes in - being a separate app and much
smaller, it can be installed as a system app and communicate with the main app
via AIDL IPC.

This has several advantages:

* Reduced disk usage in the system partition
* System updates don't remove F-Droid
* The process of installing into system via root is safer

This is packaged as an OTA (Over-The-Air) update ZIP file.  It must be installed
using TWRP or other Android recovery that can flash updates to the system from
the /data/data/org.fdroid.fdroid folder on the /data partition. The standalone
APK is called F-Droid Privileged Extension.
