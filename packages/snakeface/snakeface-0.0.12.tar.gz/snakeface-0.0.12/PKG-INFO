Description: # Snakemake Interface (snakeface)
        
        ![img/snakeface.png](img/snakeface.png)
        
        Snakeface is an interface for snakemake. If you are an individual, you can run
        it locally as a notebook to run and manage workflows. If you are an institution or group,
        you (will be able to) deploy a shared instance for others to use. To get started, please see
        the [documentation](https://snakemake.github.io/snakeface) (not created yet).
        
        **Snakeface is under development!** We are developing deployment types and features
        as they are requested. Currently, a single user notebook deployment is supported.
        Please [open an issue](https://github.com/snakemake/snakeface/issues) to request a feature, bug fix, or different deployment type.
        See the [documentation](https://snakemake.github.io/snakeface/) to get started.
        
        ## Thanks
        
        Snakeface wouldn't be possible without several open source libraries!
