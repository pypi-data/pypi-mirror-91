To Do:

* Look into gcc warnings (not shown in clang)
* Solve the predicting of all polyhedral axis from having the two with correct dihedral angle.

Testing:
* Look into symmetry - especially taking into account the average peak heights when deciding which symmetry to report.
* Look into the limits of structure overlay

Development
* Timing - are band and integration order correctly determined?
* Timing - can it be faster?
* Support non-orthogonal maps
* Change to NFFT and then change the sphere sampling for spherical harmonics, rotation function and angle-axis spheres to Fibonacci sampling.
* Switch to pybind11
* Create Homebrew build procedure for MacOS
* Create apt build procedure for Linux
* Create PyPi module for Windows
* Create MacPorts build procedure

Admin
* Get new version to CCP-EM including new interface
