"""
This module contains simple daemonization library, that takes care of all tasks
necessary to correctly daemonize a process. Correct daemonization consists of
following steps:

# Setup directories and limits
# Setup user and group permissions
# Terminal detachment with double fork and split session
# Setup signal handlers
# Close all open file descriptors (except for possible log files)
# Redirect ``stdin``, ``stdout``, ``stderr`` to ``/dev/null``
# Detect current PID and store it to appropriate PID file
# Remove PID file at process exit

These steps are performed during **full** daemonization. For many purposes it is however
usefull to be capable of some kind of **lite** daemonization, in which case almost
every step in previous list is done except for terminal detachment, closing all files
and redirecting ``std*`` to ``/dev/null``. This can be particularly usefull during
testing or debugging, or even during production deployments for some kind of
*stay in foreground* feature, which still enables the users to control the running
application from outside with signals.


Usage example
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example usage is implemented directly within this module, please refer to source
code. To view the result of demonstration please execute the module directly with
Python3 interpretter.
