### TODO List
1. Add a run command
2. Add support fom non vpackage projects
3. Install / Remove command triggers a FULL cache clear and re-download. This needs to be optimized
4. Recursive imports need to be implemented with a dependency tree check
5. Make use of version control to download a specific version of a package
6. Unit tests to see if package is functional
