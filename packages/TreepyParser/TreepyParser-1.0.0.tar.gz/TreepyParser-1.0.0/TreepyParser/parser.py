#how the parser works:
#
#We have a stack to keep track which element we are in currently
#e.g.
#
#<div>
#   <p>
#       ...inside a paragraph...
#   </p>
#</div>
#
#We have two pointers (lagging pointer and pointer) to slice parts of the html string
#e.g.   ()... is the pointer position
#
#<p(>)Example Text(<)/P>        we can use html[lagging_pointer + 1: pointer] to get the text inside the <p> element
#
#the pointer points to the current character, while the lagging pointer only changes when states change
#
#There are five states:
#0 - Traversing:
#   -is active when we are outside a tag
#   -as soon as a tag is detected we switch to state 1
#   -we create a text node with the text between the two pointers and add it to the node on top of the stack
#   -lagging pointer is set to the current character which is the opening bracket "<"
#
#1 - Tag detected:
#   -First we need to find out what type of tag we have:
#       -if the next character is a "!" we know it is a comment so we switch to state 3
#       -if the next character is a "/" we know it is a closing tag so we switch to state 4
#       -unless one of the conditions is true we know it is an opening tag
#   -if we have an opening tag:
#       -we continue until either a space or an ">" is met
#       -then we will create a new Node with the tag being the text between the two pointers
#       -the new node will be pushed onto the stack
#       -if the current character is ">" we switch back to state 0
#       -otherwise we switch to state 2
#       -lagging pointer is moved to current character
#       -if we switched to state 0, we have to check if the element we added to the stack is self closing (e.g. <input>, <img>)
#       -if yes we remove it
#
#2 - Reading attributes:
#   -we continue until a ">" is met
#   -we pass the string containing all attributes (using the pointers) to another parsing function
#   -the function returns a dictionary with all attributes that we add to the node on top of the stack
#   -if the node on top of the stack is self closing, remove it
#   -we switch back to state 0 and set the lagging pointer to the current character
#
#3 - ignoring:
#   -simply continues until end of comment is found
#   -lagging pointer is set to current character position
#   -we switch to state 0
#
#4 - Closing tag detected:
#   -we continue until end of tag is found (">")
#   -we pop last element from stack
#   -move lagging pointer to current character position
#   -switch to state 0
