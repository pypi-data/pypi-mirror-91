References

[Matt Harvey](https://github.com/harvitronix) thank you, for without you Dicebox would not be.  Much of the current implementation of dicebox comes from Matt's project below.  I originally forked Matt's work and used it until it outgrew what it was.

* [Blog Post](https://blog.coast.ai/lets-evolve-a-neural-network-with-a-genetic-algorithm-code-included-8809bece164) & [Code](https://github.com/harvitronix/neural-network-genetic-algorithm)

**Projects that I worked with heavily during prior implementations of dicebox**

* [Tensorflow & the 'slim' samples](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
* [Tensorflow models](https://github.com/tensorflow/models)
* [EasyTensorflow](https://github.com/calvinschmdt/EasyTensorflow)
