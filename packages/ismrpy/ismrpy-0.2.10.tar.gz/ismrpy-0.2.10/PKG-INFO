Description: # ismrpy
        
        Reads ismr files and provides with a panda data frame
        
        ## Getting Started
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Things needed before installation of package
        ```
        pip install numpy
        pip install pandas
        ```
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install ismrpy
        ```
        
        
        ## Usage
        Inputs-
        
            filename= Name of the file
        
        If provided with lat and lon program calculates Ionospheric pierce points.
        
            lat= latitude of station
            lon=longitude of station
            IPP=Height of ionospheric layer in kilometers (default 350 KM)
            skiprows=Number of rows to be skipped(default None)
            
        To read general ismr file
            
        ```
        import ismrpy
        data=ismrpy.read_ismr(filename=Name_of_file)
        ```
        
        To read specific files with header and with extra number of columns:
        
        ismrpy.ismr_column provides the column names, if there is an extra column in ismr (usually from ismr files from LISN networks has filename as extra column) add extra column using following command
                
        ```
        ismrpy.ismr_column.append('Name of the column')
        ```
            
        To skip the first line of the file use skiprows=1
                
        ```
        data=ismrpy.read_ismr(filename=Name_of_file,skiprows=1)
        ```
