Description: 
        ``BrainPy`` is a lightweight framework based on the latest Just-In-Time (JIT)
        compilers (especially `Numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_).
        The goal of ``BrainPy`` is to provide a unified simulation and analysis framework
        for neuronal dynamics with the feature of high flexibility and efficiency.
        BrainPy is flexible because it endows the users with the fully data/logic flow control.
        BrainPy is efficient because it supports JIT acceleration on CPUs and GPUs.
